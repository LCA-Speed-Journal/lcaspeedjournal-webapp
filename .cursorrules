# Cursor Rules for The LCA Speed Journal

## Project Context

**App:** The LCA Speed Journal  
**Stack:** Next.js 14+ (App Router), Vercel, Vercel Postgres, NextAuth.js, Tailwind CSS  
**Stage:** MVP Development  
**User level:** Between vibe-coder and developer — explain steps and trade-offs in plain language; offer a small, testable step when the user is stuck.

## Directives

1. **Master Plan:** Read `AGENTS.md` first for current phase, tasks, and full workflow. Reference `agent_docs/` for tech stack, code patterns, requirements, and testing.
2. **Plan Before Coding:** Propose a plan (and reference Python or Tech Design where relevant), wait for approval, then implement. Use Plan Mode (Shift+Tab) for complex multi-file or architectural changes.
3. **Build Incrementally:** One feature or sub-feature at a time; verify DB and API after each change.
4. **Review & Verify:** Review diffs before accepting; run `npm run dev`, hit APIs, confirm data. Fix before moving on.
5. **Explain when helpful:** Briefly say why we do something (e.g. “parameterized queries prevent SQL injection”) so the human can learn and reuse the pattern.
