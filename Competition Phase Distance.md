# Competition Phase Distance Plan (Weeks 6-9)

## Overview

**Duration:** 4 weeks (Weeks 6-9 of total season)  
**Structure:** Split A/B sessions (A: 3:45-4:45, B: 5:00-6:00)  
**Defined Meets:** W6D3 (Wed), W8D4 (Thu), W9D2 (Tue), W9D3 (Wed)  
**Placeholder Meets:** W7D3 (Wed), W7D6 (Sat)  
**Key-Pace:** 1500/mile (primary), with ±2 pacing (3k, 5k/tempo, 800)  
**Weekly volume target:** Maintain 25-30 mi/week for majority (800/1600 blend) via B-session easy runs + **assigned weekend long run** (4-6 mi; peak 6-9 mi where appropriate). For 1600/3200 or 3200-leaning athletes: +1 mi on long run.

### When Not At the Track
- **Non-track surfaces:** Grass field, 500m asphalt loop around park, or road running

---

## Key Principles from Distance Outline

### Competition Phase Priorities

- **Mile is 2026 priority:** Workouts should support mile performance while maintaining 800m speed
- **Race-specific sharpening:** Following Rubio Competition Phase examples (May-July), workouts become shorter, sharper, more race-specific
- **Maintain volume:** Continue B-session easy runs on weights days to support 25-30 mi/week. **Assigned weekend long run** (4-6 mi; peak 6-9 mi for those who can handle it). For 1600/3200 or 3200 specialist: +1 mi on long run only. On heavy meet or taper weeks, reduce long run or substitute progression run (e.g., 10 min steady, 5 min faster, 5 min controlled) per Jay Johnson to manage cumulative stress.
- **Multi-pacing maintained:** Continue ±2 pacing model over 14-day microcycles
- **Extended warmups:** Continue on track days (M/F) with Rubio **Warmup A** (mile/800-focused) or **Warmup B** (5k/tempo-focused) per [[Joe Rubio#Extended Warmups]]; Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn as bridge into workout pace
- **Primary workout per week:** One workout that makes athletes "a bit nervous" (typically Monday)
- **Chassis after hard efforts:** General strength/ancillary work immediately after primary track workout

### Transition from Preparation Phase

- **Volume:** Maintain or slightly reduce from Preparation Phase peak
- **Intensity:** Shift toward race-specific paces (mile-pace, 800-pace, race simulations)
- **Workout length:** Shorter reps, sharper focus (Rubio Competition Phase style)
- **Recovery:** More emphasis on recovery between hard efforts (meet weeks)

---

## Extended Warmup Protocol (Track Days M/F)

Aligned with [[Joe Rubio#Extended Warmups]]. Use **Warmup A** when the main workout is 400/800/mile-oriented (e.g., mile-paced reps, 800-paced work, Kosmin test). Use **Warmup B** when the main workout is 5k/tempo-oriented (e.g., 5k-paced 1000s, tempo, fartlek). Structure below follows **Warmup A** (mile/800-focused):

### Baseline (0-1.5 years experience, minimal offseason)
1. **10-15 min progressive run**
   - 5-8 min easy (conversational pace)
   - 3-5 min at aerobic threshold (slightly slower than marathon pace)
   - 2-3 min at tempo (10k race pace)

2. **4-6 strides on grass/track**
   - 2 @ 3k feel, 2 @ mile feel, 2 @ 800m feel
   - 80-100m each

3. **Pace-specific strides**
   - 1 x 150m @ 1500 pace
   - 1 x 150m @ 800 pace

4. **Recovery**
   - 3-5 min easy jog/walk before proceeding to main workout

### Veterans (Opt-up - cross-country experience, consistent offseason)
1. **20 min progressive run**
   - 10 min easy (conversational pace)
   - 5 min at aerobic threshold (slightly slower than marathon pace)
   - 5 min at tempo (10k race pace)

2. **1200-1600m Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn**
   - Continuous effort: stride the straightaway, jog the turn
   - Pacing progression: 2 @ 3k feel, 2 @ mile feel, 2 @ 800m feel
   - See [[Joe Rubio#Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn]]

3. **Pace-specific strides**
   - 1 x 150-200m @ 1500 pace
   - 1 x 150-200m @ 800 pace
   - 1 x 150m acceleration (1500/800/400 progression)

4. **Recovery**
   - 5-10 min easy jog/walk before proceeding to main workout

---

## Weekend Long Run (Assigned)

- **Role:** Primary tool to maintain weekly volume (25-30 mi target for 800/1600 blend). No AM running in this plan, so the long run is a larger share of total mileage (~15-25%).
- **Progression:** 4-6 mi for most of the season; **peak 6-9 mi** for athletes who can handle it (e.g., 1600/3200 or 3200-leaning). Prescribed as **assigned** weekend run (Saturday or Sunday), not optional.
- **Event-specific:** For athletes who trend toward 1600 specialist, 1600/3200, or 3200 specialist, add **+1 mi** to the long run (e.g., 5-7 mi instead of 4-6 mi at peak).
- **Heavy meet or taper weeks:** Per Jay Johnson, **shorten** the long run or **substitute a progression run** (e.g., 10 min steady, 5 min faster, 5 min controlled) to manage cumulative stress. Week 9 (multiple meets) is a good candidate for reduction or progression-run substitution.

#### Scenario D: Hamline Elite Meet (W7D5 - Friday) — High-Stakes Meet Preparation

**Note:** This scenario applies specifically to one distance athlete targeting the Hamline Elite Meet in the 800m. This meet takes the best athletes from across the state, and only our best distance athlete has a chance of qualifying (800m is his more competitive event). Entry list is released Wednesday afternoon of Week 7.

**Training Principles:**
- **Reduce density:** Fewer hard days per week or shorter primary workout in last 7-10 days before high-stakes meet
- **Preserve one crisp session + one tune-up:** One sharp mile/800-paced session and one controlled 800m tune-up
- **No new volume/intensity:** Maintain fitness, don't add stress
- **Race-specific sharpening:** Following Rubio Competition Phase style - shorter, sharper, more race-specific

**Two-Track Approach Based on Qualification Status:**

##### Track 1: Qualified (Known Early Week 7 - Mon/Tue)

If athlete has run well below qualifying time and qualification is virtually certain:

**Monday — Track Day (Speed/X-Factor) — PRIMARY WORKOUT (Reduced Volume)**

- **B-Session (5:00-6:00):** Primary workout — Mile-paced work (SHORTENED for taper)
  - Warmup: Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn (if not done in A-Session)
  - **Workout:** 4-5 x 400m @ mile-pace (reduced from 6-8), equal-time standing recovery
  - **Rationale:** Maintains race-specific pace but reduces volume for taper
  - Cooldown: 15-20 min easy
  - **General Strength:** 5-10 min circuit post-cooldown (light)

**Tuesday — Weights Day (Light)**

- **A-Session (3:45-4:45):** Weights work (light, meet prep focus)
- **B-Session (5:00-6:00):** Easy run after lift
  - **Veterans:** 20-25 min easy running (reduced from 25-30) + 4-6 strides
  - Purpose: Active recovery, maintain volume without stress

## Multi-Pacing Summary (14-Day Microcycles)

### Weeks 6-7 (First 2-week cycle)

- **Week 6 Monday:** 5k/tempo-pace (slower than key-pace) — PRIMARY
- **Week 6 Friday:** 800-pace (faster than key-pace) — SECONDARY
- **Week 7 Monday:** Mile-pace (key-pace) — PRIMARY
- **Week 7 Friday:** 3k-pace (slower than key-pace) — SECONDARY

**Result:** Covers key-pace (mile), ±1 (3k, 800), and ±2 (5k/tempo) over 14 days

### Weeks 8-9 (Second 2-week cycle)

- **Week 8 Monday:** Change of pace (3k → mile → better-than-mile) — PRIMARY
- **Week 8 Wednesday:** 800-pace primer — TERTIARY
- **Week 8 Friday:** 3k-pace — SECONDARY
- **Week 9 Monday:** Mile-pace — PRIMARY
- **Week 9 Friday:** Kosmin test (all-out) — ASSESSMENT

**Result:** Covers key-pace (mile), ±1 (3k, 800), change of pace, and all-out assessment

## Volume Progression

**Target:** Maintain 25-30 mi/week for majority (800/1600 blend) via B-session easy runs + assigned weekend long run (4-6 mi; peak 6-9 mi where appropriate). Longer-event athletes: +1 mi on long run.

### Baseline (0-1.5 years experience)

- **Week 6:** 15-20 min easy runs on weights days + assigned long run 4-5 mi
- **Week 7:** 15-20 min easy runs (reduced to 12-18 min if meets present) + long run 4-6 mi
- **Week 8:** 15-20 min easy runs + long run 4-6 mi
- **Week 9:** 12-18 min easy runs (reduced for multiple meets) + long run 4-5 mi or progression run substitute

### Veterans (opt-up)

- **Week 6:** 25-30 min easy runs on weights days + assigned long run 4-6 mi
- **Week 7:** 25-30 min easy runs (reduced to 20-25 min if meets present) + long run 4-6 mi (peak 6-9 mi where appropriate)
- **Week 8:** 25-30 min easy runs + long run 4-6 mi
- **Week 9:** 20-25 min easy runs (reduced for multiple meets) + long run 4-5 mi or progression run substitute

## Integration Notes

### Extended Warmups (Track Days M/F)

- **Warmup A** when main work is 400/800/mile-oriented; **Warmup B** when main work is 5k/tempo-oriented (see [[Joe Rubio#Extended Warmups]])
- Baseline: 10-15 min progressive run + strides + pace-specific strides
- Veterans: Full 20 min protocol + Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn + pace-specific strides

### B-Session Activities

- **Weights Days (T/Th):** Easy running after lift (maintains 25-30 mi/week with weekend long run)
- **Weekend:** Assigned long run 4-6 mi (peak 6-9 mi); +1 mi for 1600/3200 or 3200-leaning; reduce or progression run on heavy meet/taper weeks
- **Track Days (M/F):** Primary or secondary workouts
- **X-Factor Days (W):** Secondary workouts or 800m primer (Week 8)

### Meet Day Protocol

- Race-specific warmup (extended warmup structure if time allows)
- Post-race: Easy 10-15 min cooldown + strides
- No additional workout (meet is the workout)

### General Strength/Chassis Work

- 5-10 min circuit immediately after primary/secondary track workouts
- Focus: Core, mobility, light plyos
- Purpose: "Strengthen the chassis" (Jay Johnson) after hard efforts

## Key Changes from Preparation Phase

### Week 6

- **Monday:** Changed from undefined to 5k-pace work (1000m repeats) — supports aerobic capacity while maintaining volume
- **Friday:** Kept 800-pace work (300m repeats) but added Sprint-Float-Sprint finisher for race-specific speed

### Week 7

- **Monday:** Kept mile-pace work (400m repeats) but clarified Rubio Competition Phase format (equal-time standing recovery)
- **Friday:** Kept 3k-pace work (600m repeats)
- **Added:** Three scenarios based on meet availability (no meets, one meet, both meets)

### Week 8

- **Monday:** Kept change of pace workout (3x300m sets) — aligns with Rubio Competition Phase
- **Wednesday:** Kept Johnson-style 800m primer — good race-specific work
- **Friday:** Kept 3k-pace work (600m repeats)

### Week 9

- **Monday:** Changed from undefined to mile-pace work (4x400m) — Rubio Competition Phase style
- **Friday:** Kept Kosmin 1500m test variant — good assessment tool
