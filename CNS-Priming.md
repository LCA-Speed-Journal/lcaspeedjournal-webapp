	- **Light-Tier** — Double-Leg Pogos, Split-Stance Pogos, Captain-Morgans (SL Pogo + Hip-Hold)
	- **Medium-Tier** — SL Pogos, Bounding, sub-maximal Hopping, Crossover Bound, Gallops
	- **Ping-Tier** — Pogos for Height, Hopping, Marshalls (Split-Lunge Rebounds)
	- **Deep-Tier** — Yielding Lunge Jumps, Frog-Hops, 
- #### Speed Drills — Menu
	- **Booms** (A-Switches) — Single-Switch, Multi-Switch
	- **[[Bounce Fire Series]]** — as [[Brian Kula]]
	- **Prime-Times** — Short+Fast, Long+Strong, Bent-Knee
	- **Skips** — for Height, for Distance, for Speed
	- **PVC/Stick-Drills** — Marches, Switches, Skips
	- **Med-Ball Drills** — Marches, Switches
- #### Priming — Menu
	- ##### General Priming (anywhere) — Drops, DC, DRC
		- **Drops** (Altitude Drops, SL Drops) — after progressing to a moderate height, can add in-air twist, land to a single-leg, etc
		- **Drop-Catches** (Split-Lunge, SQ) — mix of weighted / unweighted
	- ##### Accel–Specific Priming — Sleds, 4-Step, Acc. Bounds
		- **Sled-Pushes** — Heavy Load (hip displacement and line of drive) or Medium Load (speed of turnover while emphasizing push)
		- **4-Step Drill** — From Half-Kneel, Push-Up, or Blocks
		- **Acceleration Bounds** — from Static or Skip-In, emphasizing large ROM and Thigh-Split
	- ##### MaxV-Specific Priming — Dribble Series
		- **Basic Dribbles** —  Calf, Ankle, Knee
		- **Progressive Dribbles** — Calf→Ankle→Knee, Dribble-to-Wicket Bleed, Dribble-to-Sprint Bleed
		- **Dribble Variations** — with PVC, with Med-Ball, with wickets
	- ##### Upper Priming — MB Throws
		- **Underhand/Overhead** — Most leg-driven, can be good for priming hip-extension and projection before things like acceleration
		- **Scoop Toss/Rotational** — Most torso-driven, can be good for priming torso-stability before things like max-velocity
		- **Chest Pass** — Most upper-driven, can be used as a less-demanding priming method while still priming CNS, or before weights days

> [!WARNING] Med-Ball Caveat
> We’re very resource limited when it comes to med-balls that can be thrown — 6 total, with 3 different weight-ranges.
> Using them as part of a priming series will only work well when integrated with other things — the full group of athletes needs to be able to rotate between stations and not get bottlenecked.

> **Inventory List:** 2x 8-10lb — 2x 15-18lb — 2x 20-30lb.
