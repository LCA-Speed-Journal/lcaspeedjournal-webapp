> “A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren’t strictly organised by their publication date. They’re inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren’t refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They’re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we’re used to seeing.” 

## Topography over Timelines

Connects to [[Emergent Idea Generation]] because as more notes form, they start to form patterns. Allow for more ease in navigating, feeling less categorical and more organic, making it a good fit for modeling a [[Second Brain]].
