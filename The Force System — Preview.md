## The Force System Applied in Training
Four components.
### High Force
Goal with high-force is to increase magnitude of an athlete’s force  and build resiliency against these high forces they experience in sport. Led to depth-drops, overcoming ISOs, and drop-catches.
- Ultimate high-force exercise = depth-drops.
- Second-best = harness OVC ISO (as belt-squat)
- Last primary variation = drop-catches
Instead of progressing in weight, the progression is done by increasing force 
What should be done outside the weight-room?
- Deceleration is the key quality for high-force supplementation
- Can do decel “drills” like MB chops or assisted decels, but don’t quite match the outputs
	- Games as simple as tag can allow athletes to experience high-decels, and more fun doing it
### Fast Force
- Acceleration and maxV fit in the Fast-Force theme
- Other pillar is in building elasticity:
	- Exposing soles of feet to sensation — walking on various surfaces without shoes, neurospike balls through the bottoms of the feet
	- High volumes of extensive plyometrics — transition away from muscular-driven to relying on connective tissue
- Oscillatory exercises 
	- Rhythm — smooth oscillations at a set cadence
	- Rapid — stiffer, tighter, focusing more on frequency
	- Relaxation — focusing on dropping in and returning
### Slow Force
There’s a need to disrupt homeostasis to create adaptation, but there also needs to be a “therapeutic” stimulus to restore tissue quality.
- Tendon development — yielding isometrics
	- RFE Split-Squats, push-ups, etc. Other global movements work too
- Higher volume hypertrophy
- Local tissue prep — specific attention needs ot be given to tissues/structures that are under the most stress during competition 
### Human Force
Filling the gaps within the system, highlighting innate movement patterns (crawl, climb, hang, roll, throw, gymnastics, partner combatives). Anything that allows athletes to move in an innate, foundational, and early developmental patterns.
- Example Circuit (3 rounds)
	- Lizard Crawl
	- Alternating Hang
	- FWD Roll to SL Squat
	- MB Lateral Rotational Throw
	- Cartwheel
	- Lateral shoulder-push partner combative
	- MB hug-carry
Allow Human Force to complement the other days to create a holistic and complete system. It can be done stand-alone, but often programmed as warmups before one of the other Force-System days. Daily Human Force warmups can be especially impactful in-season
## Redefining Strength — High Force Does Not Equal High Load

> [!WARNING] Disclaimer: Don’t Throw it All Out
> Back-Squats, Deadlifts, and Bench Presses are still useful, and they still have a place in training. 
> There are plenty of times they fit well, such as for athletes who are underdeveloped and have a low training age.
> Dose them with a patient progression, never with the goal of “as much weight as possible, as soon as possible.”
> This is also the case during GPP or offseason phases, when it isn’t necessary to expose athletes to the highest of forces, while having the goal of restoring sound movement patterns and training joints thru full-ROM.


# Force System Course (Preview-Content for now)
## Types of Curves
Introduced to Hunter by [[Jesse Green]].
### Unimodal Curve
- Characteriszed by having “one peak”
	- Peak is believed to show an athletes ability to harnes all potential energy generated during unweight and braking phase, and producing during propulsion
	- Most efficient from a transfer standpolint from the standpoint of a CMJ
	- Athletes that are more “elastically driven” typically display this force time curve, vs athletes that rely on a higher proportion of muscular contribution
### Bimodal Cruve
- Characterized as having two “peaks,” with the first taller.
	- Believed to show an athlete doesn’t have complete ability to harness all potential energy.
		- Transfer from brake → propulsion isn’t as efficient as a unimodal
	- Curves typically belong to “hybrid” athletes
