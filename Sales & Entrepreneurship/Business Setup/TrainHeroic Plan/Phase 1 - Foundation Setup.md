### Creating Custom Exercises in TrainHeroic

For each exercise:

2. **Video Demonstration**: Record quick videos of key movements
   - Focus on exercises unique to your programming
   - Show proper form and execution
   - Include variations when applicable
3. **Description**: Include:
   - Purpose/coaching intent
   - Key coaching cues
   - Common mistakes to avoid
   - When to use in programming
4. **Categorization**: Tag exercises by:
   - Movement pattern (push, pull, hinge, squat)
   - Training quality (speed, power, strength, capacity)
   - Body region (upper, lower, core, full-body)
   - Equipment needed

### Library Organization Strategy

**Organize by Training Phase** (matching your periodization):
- **GPP Phase**: General prep exercises, ISO work, foundational movements
- **Strength Phase**: Heavy loading, ISO holds, strength-focused variations
- **Power Phase**: Explosive movements, contrast work, Olympic lifts
- **SPP Phase**: Sport-specific movements, speed work, competition prep

**Organize by Session Type**:
- **Speed Days**: Acceleration drills, max velocity work, speed-specific priming
- **X-Factor Days**: Jumps, throws, plyos
- **Weights Days**: Strength work, Olympic lifts, accessories
