## Timeline
**Weeks 4-6** - Subscription setup and launch

---

## 4.2 Subscription Pricing

### Pricing Structure

**Recommended Monthly Pricing**: $29-49/month

**Rationale** (based on your [[Personal Training Business Outline]]):
- Your remote coaching pricing: $150-350/month
- Inner Circle is group/community model (lower than 1:1)
- Comparable to marketplace program pricing ($29-79 for 4-8 week programs)
- Annual subscription = 12 months of programming for price of 2-3 marketplace programs

**Pricing Tiers** (Optional):

**Option 1: Single Tier**
- **Inner Circle**: $39/month
  - All features included
  - Simple, no confusion

**Option 2: Two Tiers**
- **Inner Circle Standard**: $29/month
  - Monthly program updates
  - Community access
  - Basic support
- **Inner Circle Premium**: $49/month
  - All Standard features
  - Priority support
  - Exclusive content
  - Quarterly 1:1 check-ins

**Recommendation**: Start with single tier ($39/month), add tiers later if needed

### Annual vs. Monthly Billing

**Monthly Billing**:
- Lower barrier to entry
- More flexible for members
- Higher churn risk

**Annual Billing** (with discount):
- **Annual Option**: $390/year (equivalent to $32.50/month, ~17% discount)
- Better cash flow
- Lower churn
- Commitment from members

**Recommendation**: Offer both, incentivize annual with discount

### Marketplace Fees

**Your Attribution Links**:
- $1/month per subscription + 2.9% + $0.30
- Example: $39/month subscription = $1 + $1.13 + $0.30 = $2.43 in fees
- **Your Net**: ~$36.57/month per subscriber

**Marketplace Match**:
- You keep 70% (less credit card fees)
- Example: $39/month subscription = $27.30 - fees = ~$26/month net
