# Phase 2: Program Adaptation & Creation (Weeks 2-4)

## Overview
Transforming your comprehensive spreadsheet programs into marketable, generalizable versions suitable for marketplace sales and subscription models. This phase focuses on adapting athlete-specific programs into standalone offerings that maintain your unique programming philosophy.

## Timeline
**Weeks 2-4** - Program development and adaptation

---

## 2.1 Program Generalization Strategy

### Review Your Existing Programs

**Source Material** (from your Coaching notes):
- [[APEX Ready]] - 20-week program with mesocycle structure (GPP, Strength, Power, SPP)
- [[Preseason Phase]] - High-Low model with 3x/week high-intensity, 2x/week low-intensity
- [[Addy-Dixon — Block 2 — Fall 2025]] - 4-day split (Upper A, Lower A, Upper B, Total-Body)
- [[Addy-Dixon — Block 3 — Winter 2025]] - Block 3 structure with progression themes

### Generalization Process

For each spreadsheet program, follow this process:

#### Step 1: Identify Core Elements

**Training Structure**:
- Weekly split (e.g., 4-day, 5-day, 6-day)
- Training phases (GPP, Strength, Power, SPP)
- Key training blocks (speed, power, strength, recovery)
- Exercise progressions and variations
- Volume and intensity patterns

**Your Unique Programming Elements**:
- **Periodization**: Mesocycle structure (Meso-1: GPP/Strength, Meso-2: Power/SPP, etc.)
- **High-Low Model**: 3x/week high-intensity (sprints, jumps), 2x/week low-intensity (weights)
- **ISO Integration**: ISO holds, ISO tests (RSIST protocol), ISO-pauses in main lifts
- **Contrast Training**: Heavy + Plyo combinations, Resisted + Unresisted sprints
- **Special-Strength**: Sport-specific movements (Seated Leg-Lift, Wall-Attacks, Wall Trail-Pattern)
- **Performance Cycling**: Aerobic-EDT style circuits

#### Step 2: Remove Athlete-Specific Details

**Remove**:
- Athlete names and personal notes
- Specific PRs or performance targets
- Individualized modifications
- Sport-specific event details (unless creating sport-specific versions)

**Keep**:
- Exercise selection and progressions
- Set/rep schemes and tempos
- Training philosophy and structure
- Coaching cues and exercise descriptions

#### Step 3: Create Generalizable Versions

**Add Progressions for Different Skill Levels**:

**Beginner Version**:
- Lower volume (fewer sets/reps)
- Simpler exercise variations
- Longer rest periods
- More foundational movements
- Reduced intensity on speed/power work

**Intermediate Version** (Standard):
- Your original program structure
- Moderate volume and intensity
- Standard exercise variations
- Standard rest periods

**Advanced Version**:
- Higher volume (more sets/reps)
- Complex exercise variations
- Shorter rest periods
- Advanced movements (Olympic lifts, complex plyos)
- Higher intensity on speed/power work

**Add Variations for Different Sports**:
- **Basketball**: More lateral movements, change-of-direction work
- **Football**: More power emphasis, heavier loading
- **Track & Field**: Event-specific variations (sprinters, jumpers, throwers)
- **Soccer**: More conditioning, agility work
- **General Athletic**: Balanced approach

**Include Scaling Options**:
- Equipment availability (full gym vs. minimal equipment)
- Time constraints (60-min vs. 90-min sessions)
- Training frequency (3x/week vs. 5x/week)
