## Important Notes

1. **Operating Agreement**: Even for a single-member LLC, this helps maintain liability protection and clarifies business structure.

2. **Sales Tax**: Digital products (online programming) may be exempt in Minnesota, but verify with MN Department of Revenue.

3. **Contractor vs. Employee**: Ensure your school district agreement clearly establishes you as an independent contractor.

4. **Insurance**: Verify coverage includes all your services (online coaching, diagnostics, group classes, contractor work).

5. **Record Keeping**: Maintain separate business records from day one to preserve liability protection.

6. **Licensing**: 
   - Online coaching is not regulated in Minnesota
   - 1:1 coaching compliance met (age requirement, high school degree, CPR certification)
