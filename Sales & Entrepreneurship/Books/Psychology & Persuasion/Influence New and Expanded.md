# Influence: New and Expanded

## Web Summary

"Influence: New and Expanded" is an updated edition of Cialdini's classic work on the psychology of persuasion. The book presents **seven principles of influence** that guide how people are persuaded:

1. **Reciprocity** - People feel obligated to return favors
2. **Commitment and Consistency** - People want to act consistently with their commitments
3. **Social Proof** - People follow what others do
4. **Authority** - People defer to perceived experts
5. **Liking** - People are more influenced by those they like
6. **Scarcity** - People value things more when they're scarce
7. **Unity** (new in this edition) - People are more influenced by those with whom they share identity ("we" feeling)

The book combines laboratory research with real-world experiments in sales, fundraising, and marketing to show how these principles operate both ethically and manipulatively. Cialdini emphasizes ethical application and explains how digital and social environments change how these principles operate. The expanded edition includes updated content on automaticity (how people respond reflexively to triggers) and weaponizing social proof in a digital world.

Key takeaways include understanding how small favors build obligation, how visible consistent commitments lock people into supporting actions, and how shared identity activates powerful influence mechanisms.
