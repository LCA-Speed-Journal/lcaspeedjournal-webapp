# Pre-Suasion

## Web Summary

"Pre-Suasion: A Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade" focuses on what happens *before* you deliver a persuasive message. Cialdini argues that the moment before you make a request—what you direct attention to, the questions you ask, the context you create—can significantly increase persuasion effectiveness.

Key concepts include:

- **Privileged Moments** - Times when people are particularly receptive to influence
- **Attention Channeling** - What you focus attention on becomes more persuasive
- **Priming** - Using subtle cues (words, images, associations) to shape mindset in advance
- **Unity** - Building shared identity early to anchor trust and receptivity

The book shows that asking the right questions or drawing attention to particular things ahead of time makes people more likely to arrive at desired conclusions. For example, asking "Do you feel adventurous?" before making a request increases compliance. Physical or environmental cues (background imagery, context) also prime responses that influence mood and decision-making.

Cialdini emphasizes ethical use of pre-suasive techniques, noting that lasting behavioral change is more likely when preceded by pre-suasion but followed by credibility and consistency. The book provides practical strategies to "pre-suade": build association, emphasize certain values, use metaphor, time precisely, and frame choices effectively.
