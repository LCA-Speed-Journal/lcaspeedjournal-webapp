# Never Split the Difference

## Web Summary

"Never Split the Difference" translates high-stakes negotiation techniques from FBI hostage negotiation into practical tools for business and everyday life. Voss challenges traditional "win-win" or compromise-focused negotiation, emphasizing that negotiation is about emotional intelligence, not logical argument.

Key techniques include:

- **Tactical Empathy** - Acknowledging feelings without necessarily agreeing to understand the other party's perspective
- **Mirroring** - Repeating the last 1-3 words someone says to build rapport and elicit more information
- **Labeling** - Naming underlying emotions ("It sounds like..." or "It seems like...") to diffuse tension
- **Calibrated Questions** - Using "what" or "how" questions that start with these words to guide thinking while preserving the other party's sense of control
- **Embracing "No"** - Reframing "no" as a boundary setter that adds clarity, not as rejection

The book emphasizes:

- **"That's Right" Moments** - Summarizing the other party's perspective so they feel genuinely understood (more powerful than "you're right")
- **Anchoring** - Using odd numbers and strategic offers to shape expectations
- **The Ackerman Model** - Systematic approach to making offers and concessions
- **Voice and Tone** - Using a calm, slow "late-night DJ" voice to create safety and control

Voss argues that negotiation isn't about compromise—it's about exploration: discovering hidden information, understanding deeper motivations, and securing outcomes aligned with both parties' real needs. The goal is not to split the difference but to find solutions that work for everyone.
