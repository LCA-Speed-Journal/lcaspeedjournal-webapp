# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Web Summary

"Thinking, Fast and Slow" presents Kahneman's groundbreaking work on the two systems that drive human thought:

- **System 1** - Fast, automatic, intuitive, emotional. Operates effortlessly and automatically.
- **System 2** - Slow, effortful, deliberative, logical. Requires attention and mental energy.

The book shows how much of everyday thinking is dominated by System 1, with System 2 intervening only when needed for complex tasks. Many cognitive biases and errors stem from overreliance on System 1 in contexts that require deliberation.

Key concepts explored:

- **Loss Aversion** - People feel losses more acutely than equivalent gains
- **Anchoring** - The tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information encountered
- **Framing Effects** - How the same information presented differently leads to different decisions
- **Availability Heuristic** - Judging probability by how easily examples come to mind
- **Overconfidence** - People consistently overestimate their knowledge and abilities
- **Prospect Theory** - How people value gains and losses differently, leading to irrational choices

The book also explores:
- **WYSIATI** ("What You See Is All There Is") - System 1 acts on limited data, rarely considering what's unseen
- **Remembered Self vs. Experiencing Self** - How our memory of experiences differs from the actual experience
- **Peak-End Rule** - We judge experiences by their peak and how they end, not the total experience

Kahneman emphasizes that being aware of these biases helps, but we must build systems and environments to mitigate errors. For important decisions, we need to slow down and engage System 2 to avoid predictable errors.
