# The Lean Startup

## Web Summary

"The Lean Startup" introduces a methodology for building businesses under conditions of extreme uncertainty. Ries argues that traditional business planning is wasteful when you don't know who your customers are or what they want.

Core methodology centers on the **Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop**:

1. **Build** - Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test fundamental hypotheses
2. **Measure** - Collect real user feedback and data
3. **Learn** - Use validated learning to decide whether to pivot or persevere

Key concepts:

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** - The simplest version that allows you to test assumptions and get feedback
- **Validated Learning** - Using real user feedback (data) instead of assumptions or long-range planning
- **Pivot or Persevere** - Making data-driven decisions about whether to change direction
- **Continuous Deployment** - Rapid iterations and small batches to learn faster

The book emphasizes:
- **Actionable Metrics** over vanity metrics (focus on what customers actually value)
- **Small Batches** - Faster learning through rapid iterations
- **Entrepreneurship as Management** - Systematic processes, metrics, and governance even in uncertainty

Ries draws on lean manufacturing and agile software development principles, applying them to entrepreneurship. The goal is to reduce waste, avoid building products nobody wants, and find product-market fit through rapid experimentation and customer feedback.
