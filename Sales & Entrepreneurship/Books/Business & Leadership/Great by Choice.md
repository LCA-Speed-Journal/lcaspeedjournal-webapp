# Great by Choice

## Web Summary

"Great by Choice" investigates why some companies thrive in uncertainty, chaos, and randomness (10X companies) while others don't. The book examines companies that performed exceptionally well in volatile, uncertain, changing, ambiguous (VUCA) environments and identifies what distinguishes them.

Key concepts include:

1. **Fanatic Discipline** - Consistent performance regardless of external conditions. Great companies maintain discipline in both good times and bad.

2. **Empirical Creativity** - Testing and validating before making big bets. This leads to the concept of "Fire Bullets, Then Cannonballs"—test small before scaling big.

3. **Productive Paranoia** - Worrying about what might go wrong to survive unpredictable environments. Building buffers in resources and preparing for downturns.

4. **20-Mile March** - Consistent, sustainable progress versus extremes. Companies that maintain steady performance regardless of external conditions outperform those that swing between extremes.

5. **SMaC Recipe** - Specific, Methodical, and Consistent practices that ensure discipline amid chaos. A set of durable operating practices that don't change with circumstances.

6. **Return on Luck (ROL)** - Every company gets lucky or unlucky; what matters is how you respond. Great leaders build buffers, prepare for downturns, adapt, but don't overreact. They maximize their return on both good and bad luck.

The book shows that greatness is less about circumstances and more about how leaders navigate them. Successful companies don't just respond to the environment—they prepare for volatility and use disciplined thinking and action to thrive despite uncertainty.
