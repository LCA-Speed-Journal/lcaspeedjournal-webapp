# Built to Last

## Web Summary

"Built to Last" explores what makes visionary companies endure over decades—sustained greatness, not just peaks. Based on six years of research comparing visionary companies with their comparison companies, Collins and Porras identify empirical "genetic codes" of companies that have lasted through generations and multiple product cycles.

Key principles include:

1. **Clock Building, Not Time Telling** - Build a company that can prosper beyond its initial leader. Focus on building organizational systems rather than personality-led leadership. Visionary companies are not just the founders—they build institutions, not just products.

2. **Core Ideology** (Core Values + Purpose) - Companies have a guiding purpose beyond profit. The core ideology is fixed and preserved, while everything else can change.

3. **Preserve the Core / Stimulate Progress** - Maintain core values while continuously adapting and improving. This is the "Genius of AND"—embracing both stability AND change, profit AND purpose.

4. **Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs)** - Setting bold, long-term goals that challenge and inspire. These are clear, compelling, and energizing targets.

5. **Cult-Like Culture** - Strong values, tight fit, and indoctrination. People who don't fit the culture don't last, but those who do are extremely committed.

6. **Home-Grown Management** - Developing leaders from within rather than hiring from outside. Visionary companies promote from within at a much higher rate.

7. **Try Lots of Stuff & Keep What Works** - Experimentation and evolution. Good enough never is—continuous improvement and never resting on success.

Visionary companies focus on both ideology and processes to build institutions that outlast charismatic individuals. They exemplify the ability to preserve the core while stimulating progress.
