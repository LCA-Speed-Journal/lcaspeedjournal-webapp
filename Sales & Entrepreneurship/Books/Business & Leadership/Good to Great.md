# Good to Great

## Web Summary

"Good to Great" explores how some companies make the leap from average to truly great and sustain that performance over time, while many do not. Based on rigorous empirical research of approximately 1,400 companies, Collins identified 11 that made the transition and maintained results for 15+ years.

Core concepts include:

1. **Level 5 Leadership** - Humble yet driven leaders who prioritize company success over personal ego. They combine personal humility with professional will.

2. **First Who... Then What** - Get the right people in place before finalizing strategy. The right people are self-motivated and share core values.

3. **Confront the Brutal Facts** - Honest assessment of reality (the Stockdale Paradox: maintain unwavering faith while confronting the brutal facts of current reality).

4. **The Hedgehog Concept** - Find the intersection among:
   - What you're deeply passionate about
   - What you can be best in the world at
   - What drives your economic engine

5. **Culture of Discipline** - When you have disciplined people, you don't need hierarchy. When you have disciplined thought, you don't need bureaucracy. When you have disciplined action, you don't need excessive controls.

6. **Technology Accelerators** - Technology is not the driver of greatness, but great companies use technology as an accelerator to advance their Hedgehog Concept.

7. **The Flywheel Effect** - Greatness comes from consistent, cumulative effort over time, not from a single defining action. Small wins build momentum.

The book stresses that sustained performance over time and choosing what not to do is often as important as what you do.
