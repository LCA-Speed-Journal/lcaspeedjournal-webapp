# BE 2.0

## Web Summary

BE 2.0 (Beyond Entrepreneurship 2.0) is an updated version of "Beyond Entrepreneurship" (1992), combining the original content with new chapters and essays ("Jim's View from 2020") to provide a roadmap for building enduring great companies, especially for small to mid-sized enterprises.

The book focuses on **enduring greatness** in times of disruption and provides "The Map"—an integrated framework that pulls together decades of Collins's research on what makes companies endure.

Key themes include:
- **Level 5 Leadership** - humble but driven leaders who prioritize company success
- **First Who, Then What** - prioritizing people first (Who) before strategy (What)
- Building a shared and meaningful **core values/purpose**
- Aligning strategy, culture, and execution
- **Hedgehog Concept** - identifying what the company does best, what drives its economic engine, and what it is deeply passionate about
- Building culture and discipline
- **"Productive Paranoia"** - leaders must anticipate external threats and disruptions well before they materialize; safeguard the enterprise during good times

The book emphasizes long-term orientation: visionary companies invest in things that may not yield immediate rewards but build sustainability, legacy, unique offerings, and a resilient core. The emphasis is on leadership: first creating a shared, clear vision, then securing commitment to it.
