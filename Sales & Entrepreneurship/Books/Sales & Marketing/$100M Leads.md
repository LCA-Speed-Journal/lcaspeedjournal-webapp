# $100M Leads

## Web Summary

In "$100M Leads," Hormozi focuses on how to generate consistent high-quality lead flow, which he argues is the lifeblood of business. The book builds on "$100M Offers" by focusing on lead generation—the engine that fills the pipeline once you have a product people want.

The book's backbone is the **"Core Four"** lead channels:
1. **Warm outreach** - leveraging existing relationships
2. **Free content/public posting** - creating valuable content that attracts leads
3. **Cold outreach** - reaching out to new prospects
4. **Paid ads** - using advertising to generate leads

Key concepts include:
- **Lead magnets** that solve narrow problems and generate engaged interest
- Making lead magnets that solve narrow but painful problems ahead of the core offer
- Scaling via **Lead Getters** (customers, employees, agencies, affiliates)
- The "Rule of 100" (e.g., 100 interactions, 100 minutes of content, $100 in ads daily) to build momentum
- Frameworks for scaling: "More, Better, New"—do more of what works, improve it, and explore new channels when needed

Hormozi lays out a roadmap from doing lead gen yourself toward building a machine of lead generation that sustains growth, with a strong bias toward volume, consistency, and continuously optimizing for cheaper, better, and more reliable lead flow.
