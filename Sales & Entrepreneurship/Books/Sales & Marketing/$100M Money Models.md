# $100M Money Models

## Web Summary

"$100M Money Models" is about turning attention and leads into scalable, predictable, compounding revenue. Hormozi shows how to build multi-layered, cash-flow-generating infrastructures in business.

The core idea is creating a **Money Model** with three stages:
1. **"Get Cash"** via front-end offers - attract cash quickly
2. **"Get More Cash"** via upsells & downsells - increase customer value
3. **"Get the Most Cash"** through continuity - sustain maximum cash via subscriptions/memberships

Key principles:
- Every offer must recover acquisition costs quickly (ideally within 30 days)
- Stacking predictable offer layers eliminates the cash constraints that throttle growth
- Roll out one stage at a time and perfect it rather than implementing all at once
- Focus on fewer offers done extremely well instead of many average ones
- Closing gaps via affiliate partnerships helps without bloating operations
- Patient execution over quarters—not weeks—is essential

The book introduces types of money generators—continuity, trial offers, reduced-feature versions, etc.—and shows how scaling money models compounds results. Hormozi emphasizes that choosing the right model is more important than just hustle, and that systems, offers, and models that multiply effort create compounding returns.
