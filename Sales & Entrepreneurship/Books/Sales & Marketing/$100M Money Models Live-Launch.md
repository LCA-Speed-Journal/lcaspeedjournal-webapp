# Introduction
- To the Up-and-Comers: Take care of **self and family first.**
# What to Get for Being Present
Proof is at the Forefront. Each book has focused on this.
- Book 1: How to Sell ([[$100M Offers]])
- Book 2: Who to Sell to ([[$100M Leads]])
- Current Book ([[$100M Money Models]]): How to get people to give you money
	- Much Money, Small Time
# What Kills 82% of Businesses
82% of businesses fail because of **poor cash flow.**
54% of businesses lose money (or break even) every year
	Of the 46% that make money, median income listed is $48,0000.
# What Makes it Impossible to Kill a Business
Option A:
Option B:
Money Model = Sequence of Offers
	$100M Money Model: 
1. Attraction: Get to Buy
2. Upsells: Get more to Buy Up Front
3. Downsells: get something if they say no
4. Continuity: Get to buy repeatedly
Cash flow is the only thing that **guarantees** you can stay in business. 
	Need to Keep Meep Making Money.
Can do everything right (marketing, sales, employees), but fails if you **can’t make money.**
# Making a Good Money Model
- More Offers, More Money, people Buy.
- Repeated, we make money.
- $100M Model is about increasing the value of the customer, the product, and the speed of the transaction
# Applying to Current Businesses
Only 4 ways to sell: In Person vs Online; Salesman vs Self-Checkout
1. Sales In-Person
2. Sales Online
3. Self-Checkout in Person
4. Self-Checkout Online
## Alex’s Gym Model
- Win your $ Back Membership: reach the results, get your initial investment back
	- Then, it’s a selling game to get them to recur payment
# $100M Money Models System
## Attraction Mechanism
Scaling was because of Attraction Mechanistm.
	Free or discounted if it gets customer in the door and putting money down
	Done wrong, lost money on customers and go out of busines. Done right, get more money, more customres/
1. Win Money Back
	1. Pay full price, work hard to win money back
2. Giveaways
	1. puts strangers into buy-mode, and sucker with “Grand Prize”
3. Decoys
	1. Ignore the cheap stuff because they like expensive more
4. Buy X Get Y Free
	1. Gets custoemrs to buy more tahn they planned, turn into higher quantities or more months of service on the spot
5. Pay Less Now or Pay More Later
	1. Speen Bonus, gets people to
### Alex’s Personal Experience
Came at a high cost
- Wasted on stupid mistakes
- Stream of failures
- Thousands of little tweaks
- Took 10yrs of his time
Attraction Accelerator helped fix that
## Upsells
Whatever you offer next, involve more, better, etc.
- When done wrong, creates pressure, discomfort, distrust, etc.
1. Classic Upsells: Problem Reveal to sell on your next offer witout getting to realize
2. Menu Upseells: gets to realize you’re not selling that they don’t need. Ears trust
3. Anchor Upsells: Sticker-Shock that gets customers to happily spend more than plan because the main thing looks like an incredible deal
4. Rollover Upsells: Pay it Forward System turning new customers in to highest-payiung repeat buyers and gets old to reinvest
### Alex’s Personal Experience
Figured mechanisms to make upsells not only natural, but obvious they next offer is a good idea.
- Sold Supp company for $6k
Epic Upsells gives all four
## Downsells
Turning “No’s” itto deals. Downsells activate when customers say no, usually a change in payment structure, quality/quantiyty, or terms'/conditions
- Peopre gdoesn’t try to get to say yes to somethign they don’t want, but getting to yes about something they do
1. Payment Plans: Cash-Flow Algorithm stepping down customers from “I can’t afford” to “when can I start.” See seesaw tech making customers choose (___)
2. Free Trials: Skin-in-the-Game strat turning no’s into yeses by lettting customers prove to themselves that when using as directed, worth paying for
3. Feature Downsell: Custom-Fit, change qualitities, quantitites, or other product options to amx what they pay for the value they get.
## Continuity
Keep making payment sso long as you keep providing value
- Wrong: rapid cancellations burning you r reputation
What people don’t want is another monthly bill
1. Bonus Continuity: Gift-Wrapping, give them something awesome but only if they sign up “today."
2. Discount Continuity: “Free-but-When” disounts into long-term investments
3. Waived Fee: Penalty-Avoidance, incentivising avoiding a big fee by committing long term. Commit over be flexible.

## Big Decisions that Changed Alex
1. Left Job to become an entrepeneur.
	1. “The only thing guranteed: if you risk nothing, you get nothing.”
2. Learning the Gym Business
	1. Drove straight to the gym of an expert (36hrs)
	2. Got an offer to join for $10k. Waffled a little

		2. Increase changes vs doing on own
		3. Acess to the money to get started?
	3. Decision to **invest in learning skills** was what made him
3. ..
	1. The Price of Ignorance is steep. We pay with whatever we value least.
	2. Made decision before ready, but acted to catapult into now
4. Starting 1st Gym with Partner who Never Was
	1. Partner suggested a workshop: learned facebook ads in 2012
	2. Partner backed out before signing the lease, Alexs had to make up the difference
	3. Bottom Line: ROI should be least of concerns. Learning skills is always worth it. Winners only become winner by taking action.
	4. Need to take a bet ohn yourself, only asset you can’t leose, so investing is the best long-term decision you can make
5. ..
	1. One member changed perspective. “Don’t have the money. But I’m going to do it anyways. I’ll figure it out.”

6. ..

		1. Solution was high price, but rewalization was that going to pay with time, or pay with money, but only one you can get back.
	2. Learned about semi-privates, how to sell higher-ticket services.
7. Going all In
	1. Only knew how to run local ads, didn’t know how to do global.
8. Next Big Bet: Skills
	1. Got stuck ($30M anually), found a podcast, connected him to a guy who reccomended how he advertise differently
		1. “If you’ve done somethign in the past and didn’t work…only thing worse than making one bad is letting a bad investment spoil the future outcome.”
