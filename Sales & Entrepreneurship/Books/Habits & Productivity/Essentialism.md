# Essentialism

## Web Summary

"Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less" proposes a disciplined way of life: determine the vital few things that matter, and eliminate the rest. McKeown argues that true productivity and meaning come from focusing on what is truly essential—doing fewer things better rather than trying to do everything.

Core principles:

- **The Disciplined Pursuit of Less** - Not about doing more, but doing better by focusing on what matters most
- **Trade-offs Are Inevitable** - You can't do everything; saying "no" to good opportunities is the cost of saying "yes" to the best ones
- **Discernment** - Ability to identify the most important among many options

Key practices:

- **The 90 Percent Rule** - If something doesn't score 90% or higher, decline it
- **Create Space to Think** - Protect time for reflection and evaluation
- **Say "No" Gracefully** - Set boundaries and eliminate non-essentials
- **Design Your Environment** - Make essential things obvious and non-essentials invisible
- **Focus on Trade-offs** - Acknowledge that choosing one thing means not choosing another

The book emphasizes mindset shifts:
- From "I have to" → "I choose to"
- From "It's all important" → "Only a few things matter"
- From "How can I do it all?" → "What is the right thing to do?"

Essentialism is about living by design rather than by default—investing energy only in the few things that align with your purpose and values, and letting go of ambition that isn't aligned. The goal is to achieve more by doing less, but better.
