# Atomic Habits

## Web Summary

"Atomic Habits" provides a framework for building good habits and breaking bad ones through small, incremental improvements. Clear argues that tiny changes ("atomic habits") compound over time into significant results—improving by just 1% daily results in about 37× improvement over a year.

The book breaks habits into a four-stage loop:
1. **Cue** - The trigger that initiates the behavior
2. **Craving** - The motivational force behind the habit
3. **Response** - The actual habit performed
4. **Reward** - The end goal that satisfies the craving

Clear introduces the **Four Laws of Behavior Change**:
- **Make it obvious** - Design clear cues for good habits
- **Make it attractive** - Increase the craving
- **Make it easy** - Reduce friction
- **Make it satisfying** - Provide immediate rewards

To break bad habits, invert these laws: make them invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying.

**Identity-based habits** are foundational: lasting change comes when you shift your identity ("I am a runner") rather than focusing purely on outcomes ("I want to run a marathon"). The book emphasizes systems over goals—design your environment, refine your identity, and shape your processes.

Key tactics include:
- **Habit stacking** - Linking new habits to existing ones
- **The Two-Minute Rule** - Make new habits so small they're easy to start
- **Environment design** - Make cues for good habits obvious and bad habits invisible
- **Temptation bundling** - Pair something you want to do with something you need to do
