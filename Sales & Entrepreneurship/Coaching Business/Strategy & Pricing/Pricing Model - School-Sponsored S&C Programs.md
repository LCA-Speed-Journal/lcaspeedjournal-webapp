## Cost Analysis: Break-Even and Coach Compensation Scenarios

### Break-Even Analysis: Out-of-Season Athletes Needed

**Program Costs (12-Week Program)**: $4,550-$6,350

**In-Season Revenue (Based on Actual Participation)**:
- **Fall**: 41-45 athletes × $50 = $2,050-$2,250
- **Winter**: 38 athletes × $50 = $1,900
- **Spring**: 36-42 athletes × $50 = $1,800-$2,100

**Out-of-Season Revenue Needed to Break Even**:
- **Fall**: $4,550-$6,350 - $2,050-$2,250 = **$2,300-$4,300 needed**
- **Winter**: $4,550-$6,350 - $1,900 = **$2,650-$4,450 needed**
- **Spring**: $4,550-$6,350 - $1,800-$2,100 = **$2,450-$4,550 needed**

**Out-of-Season Athletes Needed (at $180-$220 per athlete)**:
- **Fall**: $2,300-$4,300 ÷ $180-$220 = **10.5-23.9 athletes** → **11-24 athletes needed**
- **Winter**: $2,650-$4,450 ÷ $180-$220 = **12.0-24.7 athletes** → **12-25 athletes needed**
- **Spring**: $2,450-$4,550 ÷ $180-$220 = **11.1-25.3 athletes** → **12-26 athletes needed**

**Break-Even Benchmark**: **12-15 out-of-season athletes** (mid-range estimate across all seasons)

## Recommended Pricing Structure

### Pricing Model: Combined Revenue with Percentage-Based Compensation

**Compensation Model**:
- **Coaches**: 70% of total program revenue
- **School**: 20% of total program revenue
- **Program Costs**: 10% of total program revenue

- **Reasonable alternative** to commercial gyms (which offer no coaching)
- **Much cheaper** than club sports

**Example Calculation (12-Week Program, 70% Coach Share)**:

2. **Then Reveal School Program**: $180-$220 for 12 weeks
3. **Result**: Massive value perception (80-88% savings)

- Full sport participation: $300-$350 per season
- S&C add-on (in-season): $40-$60 per athlete
- **Out-of-season S&C at $180-$220**: **Higher than in-season add-on** but justified by standalone program value
- **Value**: Consistent, affordable S&C year-round with professional coaching
- **Framing**: "Complete your athletic development year-round for less than one club sport season"
- **Commitment Principle**: "Athletes who train year-round see the best results"

### Sales Script: The "That's Right" Conversation

**Opening (Pre-Suasion - Prime for Partnership):**
"I'd like to show you how we can provide professional strength & conditioning coaching for your athletes while eliminating all financial risk for the school. Does that sound like something worth exploring?"

**Value Presentation (Value Equation):**
"Here's what we're proposing: A percentage-based revenue share model where the school receives 20% of program revenue, and coaches receive 70%. This means:

- **If enrollment is low**: Coaches earn less, school pays less - we share the risk
- **If enrollment exceeds expectations**: Coaches are rewarded for successful marketing, school receives more revenue
- **No fixed cost burden**: School only pays percentage of actual revenue generated
- **Aligned incentives**: We're motivated to make this program successful because our compensation depends on it

**The alternative** is hiring a full-time S&C coordinator at $50,000-$70,000/year. Our program costs the school approximately $5,000-$6,000/year - that's **90% cost savings** with zero risk."

**Calibrated Questions (Never Split the Difference):**
- "What would need to be true for this to be a no-brainer decision for the school?"
- "What concerns do you have about implementing a program like this?"
- "How would this program impact your athletic department's goals?"

**That's Right Moment:**
"So if I understand correctly, you're looking for a way to provide professional S&C coaching to your athletes without taking on fixed costs or financial risk, while still ensuring coaches are motivated to make the program successful. Is that right?"

**Close (Commitment & Consistency):**
"This model protects the school while creating a true partnership where everyone benefits from program success. Would you like to see the detailed revenue projections, or do you have questions about how this would work in practice?"

**Objection 1: "We don't have budget for this"**
- **Label the Emotion**: "It sounds like budget is a concern. Is that right?"
- **Calibrated Question**: "What would need to be true for this to work within your budget?"
- **Reframe**: "That's exactly why we created the percentage model - no fixed budget needed. You only pay when the program generates revenue. What if we started with a pilot program to prove the concept?"

**Objection 2: "We're not sure about enrollment numbers"**
- **Tactical Empathy**: "I understand the uncertainty. That's why we built risk-sharing into the model."
- **That's Right Moment**: "So you're concerned that if enrollment is low, the school would be stuck with costs. Is that right?"
- **Solution**: "That's exactly what our percentage model solves - if enrollment is low, coaches earn less. We share the risk. Would it help to see the break-even analysis?"

**Objection 3: "We already have a strength program"**
- **Calibrated Question**: "What's working well with your current program, and what would you like to improve?"
- **Mirror**: "You already have a strength program..."

**Objection 5: "The percentage seems high for coaches"**
- **Reframe**: "Actually, the 70% coach share ensures we're highly motivated to make this successful. If enrollment is low, we earn less - we're invested in the program's success."
- **Calibrated Question**: "What percentage would feel fair to you, and why?"
- **That's Right**: "So you want to ensure the school gets fair value. Is that right?"

**The "No" Response Framework:**
1. **Embrace "No"**: "I appreciate you being direct. That helps me understand what you need."
2. **Label**: "It sounds like [concern]. Is that right?"

## Notes & Adjustments

### Key Financial Considerations

**Percentage-Based Revenue Share Model**:
- Coaches receive 70% of total program revenue
- School receives 20% of total program revenue
- Program costs (equipment, admin) receive 10% of total program revenue
- **No fixed stipend burden** for school - only pays percentage of actual revenue
- **Aligned incentives** - coaches rewarded for enrollment success

**Revenue Share Benefits**:
- **For School**: Risk mitigation - no fixed cost if enrollment is low
- **For Coaches**: Upside potential - rewarded for exceeding enrollment targets
- **For Program**: Scalable model that works at any enrollment level (12-26 athletes)
- **Win-Win Structure**: Everyone benefits from program success

**Athlete Fee Rationale**:
- Out-of-season: $180-$220 per 12-week program = $15-$18.33 per week
- Out-of-season: $180-$220 per 12-week program = $5-$6.11 per session (at 3-4 sessions/week)
- **Still 60-80% below** private facility rates ($1,260-$1,800 for 12 weeks)
- **Reasonable alternative** to commercial gyms (which offer no coaching)
- **Much cheaper** than club sports ($1,200-$3,000+ per season)

### Annual Review Factors
- Enrollment trends and program demand
- Revenue share percentage adjustments (if needed)
- Coach compensation levels vs. enrollment
- School revenue from program (20% share)
- Facility/equipment costs
- Market conditions and competitor pricing
- Parent/athlete feedback
- Program profitability and sustainability

### Flexibility Considerations
- **Minimum enrollment**: Set minimum (e.g., 12 athletes) to ensure program viability
- **Maximum enrollment**: Cap at 26 to maintain quality coaching ratios
- **Rotating schedule**: Ensure all groups get 3-4 sessions/week
- **Cancellation policy**: Define refund policy for mid-program withdrawals
- **Make-up sessions**: Policy for missed sessions due to illness/school events
- **In-season vs. out-of-season**: Balance enrollment to optimize revenue
