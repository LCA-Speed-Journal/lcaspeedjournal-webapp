# Phased Rollout Checkpoints — School S&C Program

*Detailed implementation checkpoints and to-dos for the school-sponsored strength and conditioning program rollout. See [[Phased Rollout — School S&C]] for high-level overview.*

---

# Potential To-Dos (Can Start Early)
*Preparatory tasks that can be completed independently, without requiring meetings, approvals, or other dependencies. These can be done in advance to get ahead.*
## Priority Ranking (Highest Return First)
### 🔴 Critical Priority (Start Immediately)
*These are foundational, reduce risk, enable Phase 0 approval, or inform major decisions:*
- [ ] **Draft presentation deck outline/structure** - Needed for Phase 0 to sell to admin. This is your first hurdle and can be refined as you gather more info.
- [ ] **Draft contract/agreement template** - Protects your interests, clarifies terms early, and can be negotiated during Phase 0 approval process.
- [ ] **Draft safety protocols document** - Required before any programs start, protects against liability, and demonstrates professionalism to admin. Now that insurance research is done, you know what's required.
- [ ] **Research flooring options (deadlift platform, rubber flooring)** - Last major facility prep item. Affects equipment installation timeline and may require school facility work coordination. Critical for Phase 0 equipment planning.
- [x] **Research liability insurance options and requirements** - Critical for risk management. Insurance may be required before approval and affects program viability. ✅ 2026-01-24
- [x] **Research electrical requirements for weight room equipment** - Informs equipment decisions and facility prep. May affect vendor selection and installation timeline. ✅ 2026-01-24
- [x] **Research ventilation/airflow standards for weight rooms** - Similar to electrical - affects facility prep and may require school facility work before installation. ✅ 2026-01-24
### 🟡 High Priority (Start Soon)
*These enable Phase 0/1A work or reduce future bottlenecks:*
- [ ] **Create compensation structure document** - Needed for contract negotiations and staff recruitment. Should be ready before contract discussions.
- [ ] **Draft job descriptions for Head Coach and Assistant Coach** - Needed for staffing, which may be required before Phase 0 approval or early in Phase 1A. Complements compensation structure.
- [ ] **Research accounting/tracking systems for revenue split** - Critical for the revenue model. Need to track accurately for the 75/10/15 split. Affects contract terms and operational setup.
- [ ] **Research payment processing systems for athlete fees** - Affects enrollment system design and may need to be integrated with school systems. Needed for Phase 1A enrollment.
- [ ] **Develop program structure templates** - Foundation for all program design work. Can be reused across all phases and saves time later.
- [ ] **Create session templates for different program types** - Enables faster program development once you know what you're offering.
### 🟢 Medium Priority (Start Before Phase 1A)
*These are needed for program launch but can wait until Phase 0 is approved:*
- [ ] **Draft registration form templates** - Needed for Phase 1A enrollment.
- [ ] **Draft waiver/liability forms for participants** - Required before any participants start.
- [ ] **Draft parent/guardian consent forms** - Required for student participants.
- [ ] **Draft medical clearance forms** - May be required by school policy.
- [ ] **Create participant welcome packet template** - Improves participant experience and reduces questions.
- [ ] **Research online registration platforms** - Needed for efficient enrollment process.
- [ ] **Develop program designs for Pilot program** - Phase 1A is your first real test; having this ready reduces stress.
- [ ] **Create feedback survey templates** - Needed for Phase 1A evaluation and improvement.
### 🔵 Lower Priority (Can Wait)
*These are valuable but not urgent - can be done closer to when they're needed:*
- [ ] **Marketing material** templates (needed closer to Phase 1B launch)
- [ ] **Program designs** for later phases (can build on pilot learnings)
- [ ] **Phase 3 research** (powerlifting club, NHSSCA, fundraisers) - Too far out, priorities may change
- [ ] **Baseline assessment** protocols - Can be refined based on pilot feedback
- [ ] **System design** templates - Can be built as you learn what you need
