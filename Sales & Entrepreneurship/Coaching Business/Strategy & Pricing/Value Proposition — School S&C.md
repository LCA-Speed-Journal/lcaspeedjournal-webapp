# Value Proposition: School-Sponsored Strength & Conditioning Program

## Executive Summary

A risk-free, percentage-based strength & conditioning program that delivers professional coaching to student-athletes at 97-98% less cost than a full-time coordinator (or 88-90% less than a stipend-based model), with minimal financial risk for the school.

---

## The Core Offer: Risk-Free Partnership Model

### What We're Proposing

A **percentage-based revenue share partnership** where:

- **School pays nothing upfront** — no fixed stipend, no budget commitment
- **We take on the risk** — if enrollment is low, coaches earn less (we're invested in success)
- **School benefits from our success** — as enrollment grows, school revenue increases
- **No renegotiation needed** — model scales automatically with enrollment

### Revenue Distribution Model

- **Coaches (Head + Assistant)**: 75% of total program revenue
- **School Facility/Overhead**: 10% of total program revenue  
- **Program Fund (Future Expansions in Equipment, etc.)**: 15% of total program revenue

*Note: This model aligns incentives — coaches are rewarded for successful enrollment and marketing, while the school is protected from fixed cost burden.*

---

## The Value Equation: Why This Works for Schools

### 1. Unmatched Cost Savings

**The Alternatives: Full-Time S&C Coordinator, or Stipend-Based Staff Add-On**

- Average S&C Coordinator Annual salary: $40,000-$60,000 (fixed cost, regardless of results)
- Benefits and overhead: Additional $10,000-$15,000
- **Total annual cost: $50,000-$75,000**
- Stipend-Based Staff Add-On: $3000 per term, or $9,000 annually
- Trade-Offs: bandwidth considerations for staff members, payment regardless of program enrollments (budget risk if enrollments can't break even to the committed pay-out)

**Our Program: Percentage-Based Model**

- School receives 10% of program revenue for facility/overhead
- Estimated annual revenue: $11,650-$12,760 (moderate to optimistic enrollment scenario)
- **School cost: ~$1,054-$1,276 annually** (10% of revenue)
- **Cost savings: 97-98% compared to full-time coordinator** ($50,000-$75,000 vs. $1,054-$1,276)
- **Cost savings: 88-90% compared to stipend-based model** ($9,000 annually vs. $1,054-$1,276)

### Cost Comparison Table

| Model | Annual Cost to School | Financial Risk | Scalability | Enrollment Dependency |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Full-Time Coordinator** | $50,000-$75,000 | High (fixed cost) | Limited | No dependency |
| **Stipend-Based Add-On** | $9,000 | Medium (fixed per term) | Limited | Budget risk if low enrollment |
| **Percentage-Based (Our Model)** | $1,054-$1,276 | None (scales with revenue) | High | Automatic adjustment |

### 2. Minimized Financial Risk

- **No fixed stipend burden** if enrollment is low
- **School only pays percentage** of actual revenue generated
- **If program underperforms**, coaches take on the most risk (earn less)
- **Scalable model** works at any enrollment level (12-26 athletes per program)

### 3. Aligned Incentives

- Coaches motivated to market program effectively
- Coaches rewarded for exceeding enrollment targets
- Creates partnership mentality: "We succeed together"
- School benefits from program success automatically

### 4. Proven Track Record

**Head Coach Credentials:**

- Certified High School Strength & Conditioning Coach (NHSSCA)
- Certified Speed and Agility Coach (National Sports Performance Association)
- Performance Coaching Certification (University of Minnesota)

## Financial Projections: Moderate Scenario

### In-School Revenue Breakdown (3 Seasonal Programs)

**Assumptions:**

- 8-12 out-of-season athletes per 12-week program (break-even benchmark)
- Mid-range in-season participation (35-40 athletes average)
- Out-of-season pricing: $175-$195 per athlete (using $185 mid-range for calculations)
- In-season pricing: $50 per athlete (mid-range of $40-$60)

**Fall Season:**

- In-Season Athlete Revenue: 40 athletes × $50 = $2,000
- Out-of-Season Athlete Revenue: 10 athletes × $185 = $1,850
- **Total Revenue: $3,850**
- Coaches (75%): $2,888
- School (10%): $385
- Program Fund (15%): $578

**Winter Season:**

- In-Season Athlete Revenue: 40 athletes × $50 = $2,000
- Out-of-Season Athlete Revenue: 10 athletes × $185 = $1,850
- **Total Revenue: $3,850**
- Coaches (75%): $2,888
- School (10%): $385
- Program Fund (15%): $578

**Spring Season:**

- In-Season Athlete Revenue: 42 athletes × $50 = $2,100
- Out-of-Season Athlete Revenue: 10 athletes × $185 = $1,850
- **Total Revenue: $3,950**
- Coaches (75%): $2,963
- School (10%): $395
- Program Fund (15%): $593

**Annual Totals (3 Seasonal Programs):**

- **Coaches (75%): $8,738**
- **School (10%): $1,165**
- **Program Fund (15%): $1,748**

### Break-Even Analysis

**Break-Even Point:** 8-12 out-of-season athletes per 12-week program

**Why This Works:**

- In-season revenue ($2,000-$2,100 with 35-50 athletes) significantly subsidizes program costs
- Out-of-season pricing ($175-$195) ensures sufficient revenue while remaining competitive
- Percentage model aligns incentives: coaches rewarded for enrollment success
- School protected: only pays percentage of actual revenue generated
- Program Fund (15%) covers equipment maintenance, administrative costs, and future program growth

### Program Fund (15%): What It Covers

The 15% Program Fund allocation ensures program sustainability and growth:

**Equipment & Maintenance:**

- Equipment repairs and replacement parts
- Safety equipment updates (first aid supplies, AED maintenance)
- Equipment upgrades and expansion

**Future Growth:**

- Reserve for equipment expansion
- Program capacity increases
- Additional program offerings (Phase 2, Phase 3)

**Transparency:** Program Fund usage will be tracked and reported to school administration, ensuring accountability and program sustainability.

### Enrollment Flexibility & Model Adaptability

**How the Model Adapts:**

The percentage-based revenue share model automatically adjusts to enrollment levels:

- **Low Enrollment (8 out-of-season athletes):** 
- Coaches earn less (75% of lower revenue)
- School earns less (10% of lower revenue)
- Program Fund receives less (15% of lower revenue)
- **No fixed cost burden for school**

- **Moderate Enrollment (10 out-of-season athletes):**
- Balanced revenue distribution
- Sustainable program operations
- Break-even point achieved

- **High Enrollment (12+ out-of-season athletes):**
- Coaches rewarded for successful marketing
- School receives increased revenue (10% of higher revenue)
- Program Fund grows for future expansion
- **Everyone benefits from success**

**Key Advantage:** Unlike fixed-cost models (full-time coordinator or stipend-based), this model scales automatically without renegotiation or budget adjustments. The school is never "stuck" with a bad deal if enrollment is lower than expected.

### Revenue Scenarios Comparison

**Conservative Scenario (8 out-of-season athletes per season):**

- Fall: (40 × $50) + (8 × $185) = $2,000 + $1,480 = $3,480
- Winter: (40 × $50) + (8 × $185) = $2,000 + $1,480 = $3,480
- Spring: (42 × $50) + (8 × $185) = $2,100 + $1,480 = $3,580
- **Annual Total: $10,540**
- Coaches (75%): $7,905
- School (10%): $1,054
- Program Fund (15%): $1,581

**Moderate Scenario (10 out-of-season athletes per season):**

- **Annual Total: $11,650** (as calculated above)

**Optimistic Scenario (12 out-of-season athletes per season):**

- Fall: (40 × $50) + (12 × $185) = $2,000 + $2,220 = $4,220
- Winter: (40 × $50) + (12 × $185) = $2,000 + $2,220 = $4,220
- Spring: (42 × $50) + (12 × $185) = $2,100 + $2,220 = $4,320
- **Annual Total: $12,760**
- Coaches (75%): $9,570
- School (10%): $1,276
- Program Fund (15%): $1,914
