# Pricing Model: Personal Training & Offseason Programming
## High School Athletes - Minnesota Market

## Business Context & Constraints

### Key Factors Affecting Pricing Strategy

**1. Side Hustle / Part-Time Operation**
- Operating as afternoon/evening business around 7am-3pm day job
- Advantage: Timing aligns perfectly with high school athletes' after-school schedules
- Implication: Can't compete on availability with full-time trainers; focus on value and quality
- Pricing Strategy: Position as premium, focused service rather than competing on volume

**2. Limited 1:1 Coaching Experience**
- **Background**: Extensive group/team coaching experience (6+ years track & field, 3+ years S&C)
- **Strength**: Strong programming experience and athlete development track record
- **Challenge**: New to one-on-one personal training format
- **Pricing Implication**: 
  - Start conservatively on 1:1 pricing until experience builds
  - Emphasize programming expertise over hands-on coaching
  - Remote/Hybrid models play to strengths better than pure 1:1

**3. Certification Status**
- **Credentials**: NHSSCC (NHSSCA Certified High School Strength & Conditioning Coach)
- **Not Certified**: Not a certified personal trainer (CPT)
- **Implication**: 
  - Cannot position as "certified personal trainer"
  - Can position as "certified high school strength & conditioning coach" - more specific/relevant to target market
  - Programming-focused services align better with credentials than hands-on training

**4. No Dedicated Facility**
- **Constraint**: No own facility; would work out of shared box gym
- **Challenge**: Box gyms often restrict or prohibit non-staff personal training
- **Risk**: Potential conflict with gym policies could affect athlete or coach
- **Pricing Implication**: 
  - **De-emphasize 1:1 in-person** as primary offering initially
  - **Focus on Remote/Hybrid models** (remote programming + occasional technique checks)
  - **1:1 sessions** should be positioned as "add-ons" or "technique coaching" rather than full training
  - Consider pricing 1:1 lower initially due to constraints/risks

**5. No Established Client List**
- **Starting Point**: One interested athlete, no existing client base
- **Implication**: 
  - Start with conservative pricing to build client base and testimonials
  - Early clients can be "founding member" pricing or referral incentives
  - Focus on building proof/results before raising rates

### Recommended Positioning Based on Constraints

**Primary Service Focus:**
1. **Remote Programming** (Tier 1) - Plays to programming strength, no facility needed
2. **Hybrid Coaching** (Tier 2) - Occasional in-person for technique/form checks (can be done safely at gym or athlete's home)
3. **1:1 In-Person** (Tier 3) - De-emphasize initially due to facility constraints and limited 1:1 experience

**Initial Pricing Strategy:**
- **Start 10-15% below recommended ranges** to build client base and testimonials
- **Emphasize programming expertise** and track record with team athletes
- **Position as specialized** high school S&C coach rather than general personal trainer
- **Build proof** with early clients before raising to full market rates

**Competitive Advantages to Emphasize:**
- Certified high school S&C coach (specific credential for target market)
- Track record with high school athletes (2 NCAA athletes, state qualifiers)
- Programming expertise (10 years in field)
- Afternoon/evening availability aligns with athlete schedules
- Flexible remote/hybrid model

### Minnesota Market Benchmarks

| Service Type | MN Local Examples | Price Range |
|---|---|---|
| **1:1 In-Person Training** | Pure Intensity (MN): Private 60-min sessions<br>Happy Human (Minneapolis)<br>HammerZone Sports | $75-$105/session<br>$85-$105/session<br>$83-$105/session (volume discounts) |

| **Small Group Training** | Pure Intensity group rates<br>HammerZone small groups | $35/session per athlete<br>$29-$37/session (1-3×/week packages) |

### ETS Performance Model (Key Competitor)

**Service Model**: ETS Performance operates a premium small-group training model (not primarily 1:1) with facilities nationwide, including multiple Minnesota locations (Central/Edina, Duluth, East Metro, Mankato, North Metro, Northeast Metro, Northwest Metro, Plymouth, Rochester, South Metro, Southeast Metro, St. Croix, West Metro).

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Pricing Structure**: Not publicly disclosed; requires "free evaluation" consultation to discuss pricing (common premium positioning strategy)
- **Program Offerings**: 
  - **Youth Speed Plus** (ages 8-11): Small group speed development
  - **Total Performance** (ages 12+): Small group training blending speed, strength, power, agility (most relevant for high school athletes)
  - **Combine Prep** (high school/college): Test-specific preparation
  - **Pro Training**: Individualized for elite athletes
  - **Team Training**: On-site or in-facility team programs
- **Service Delivery**: In-person small group sessions (not remote programming); personalized programming within coached groups
- **Value Propositions**: 
  - Data-driven tracking using VALD Performance testing
  - Re-testing every ~6 weeks
  - Certified coaches (CSCS, NSCA, USAW credentials)
  - Sport/position-specific coaching cues
  - Phase-based periodization
- **Session Frequency**: Typically 2-4 sessions/week recommended (most athletes see best results at 2-4 sessions/week per their FAQ)

**Competitive Positioning Insights:**
- ETS uses a "free evaluation" model rather than transparent pricing (common for premium services)
- Their model is facility-based small-group training, which creates a different value proposition than remote/hybrid coaching
- Their focus on data-driven tracking and 6-week re-testing cycles aligns with performance-based pricing models
- Athletes who have used ETS are familiar with structured, periodized programs and performance testing expectations
- **Positioning Opportunity**: Your remote/hybrid model offers flexibility and personalization that ETS's small-group facility model cannot provide, while potentially at a lower price point

### ETS Virtual Training (Online Coaching Pricing)

**ETS offers online coaching tiers:**
- **1-on-1 Coaching**: $399.99/month (or $35/month × 12 months = $420/year with annual commitment)
  - 3-month minimum commitment
  - Weekly check-ins
  - Fully customized programs via training app
  - Access to live messaging with coach
  - General nutrition guide

- **ETS VIP Coaching**: $997/month
  - 3-month minimum commitment
  - Daily check-ins via text
  - 24/7 access to private phone number
  - Video analysis anytime
  - Specific calorie/macro targets
  - Nutritionist collaboration

**Key Insight**: ETS's online pricing is **$400-$1,000/month** for remote coaching, which positions their in-person facility training likely at a similar or higher price point. This suggests a premium market position that you can reference when pricing your services.

### Reddit Community Research (Online Trainer Pricing)

**Common Pricing Ranges from Trainer Discussions:**
- **Entry-level online trainers**: $35-$100/month for basic programming
- **Mid-tier trainers**: $200-$400/month for custom programming with check-ins

- **VIP/elite trainers**: $800-$1,500+/month for daily check-ins, video analysis, nutrition

**Key Themes from Trainer Discussions:**
- **Most trainers underprice initially** - common mistake is starting too low, making it difficult to raise rates later
- **Package-based pricing preferred** over hourly rates for online coaching
- **Tiered structures work best** - offering 3-4 pricing levels captures different client segments
- **Monthly subscriptions** provide more stable revenue than one-time packages
- **Profit margin targets**: 60%+ considered healthy for sustainable business
- **Clear package definitions** reduce refund requests and client dissatisfaction

**Pricing Frequency Adjustments:**
Trainers commonly adjust pricing based on training frequency:
- 3×/week: Base pricing tier
- 4-5×/week: Standard tier (most popular)
- 6×/week: Premium tier with 15-20% premium over standard

**Reddit Community Insights:**
- Trainers building $10K+/month businesses typically:
  - Start with in-person training to build reputation
  - Transition to hybrid/online models once fully booked
  - Emphasize retention over constant new client acquisition
  - Use add-on services (nutrition, video analysis) to increase revenue
  - Offer payment plans for longer commitments (3-6 month packages)

### National Average Context
- **1:1 Personal Training**: $40-$70/hr (rural/suburban), $60-$100/hr (urban areas), can exceed $100/hr in premium markets
- **Online/Remote Coaching**: $80-$400/month depending on support level, customization, and check-in frequency
- **Youth Sports Performance**: $65-$125 per 1:1 session; $15-$40 per person for groups; $200-$800/month for full programs

## Pricing Framework: Applying the Value Equation

From [[$100M Offers]]: **Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)**

### Maximizing Value in Pricing Structure:
1. **Increase Dream Outcome**: Position packages as pathway to college athletics, improved performance, injury prevention
2. **Increase Perceived Likelihood**: Highlight credentials, success stories (2 NCAA athletes, state qualifiers), track record
3. **Decrease Time Delay**: Emphasize offseason = prime development window, structured blocks with clear timelines
4. **Decrease Effort & Sacrifice**: Payment plans, sibling discounts, upfront package discounts

---

### Tier 2: Hybrid Coaching
**Target Market**: Athletes wanting personal attention but flexibility, families wanting value + accountability

**Why This Tier Works Well:**
- **Balances strengths**: Programming expertise + occasional hands-on guidance
- **Flexible in-person options**: Can be done at gym, athlete's home, or outdoor space
- **Lower facility risk**: Not full 1:1 training, just technique/form checks

- Emphasize programming value and flexible delivery method
- Build client base before raising to full market rates

---

### Tier 3: 1:1 In-Person Coaching
**⚠️ Recommended: De-Emphasize Initially Due to Constraints**

**Challenges with This Tier:**
- **No facility**: Box gym restrictions on non-staff personal training create risk
- **Limited 1:1 experience**: All coaching background is group/team settings
- **Not certified CPT**: May face questions about qualifications for hands-on training
- **Side hustle constraints**: Less availability for regular in-person sessions

**Better Positioning:**
- **Reposition as "Technique Coaching"** or "Program Implementation Support"
- **Offer as add-on** to Remote/Hybrid packages rather than standalone service
- **Focus on specific sessions**: Movement assessments, form corrections, not full training sessions
- **Alternative venues**: Athlete's home gym, school weight room, outdoor space

**If Offering 1:1 In-Person (Modified Approach):**

**What's Included (Modified):**
- Technique and form coaching sessions (not full training)
- Program implementation support and adjustments
- Movement assessments and corrective exercises
- Sport-specific skill development
- **Note**: Athlete does majority of training on own, you provide guidance/corrections

**Pricing Structure (Conservative - Start Lower):**
| Session Frequency | Per Session Rate | Monthly Cost (approx) | **Starting Rate** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1×/week** | $90-$110/session | $360-$440/month | **$75-$90/session** (first 3-5 clients) |
| **2×/week** | $85-$105/session | $680-$840/month | **$70-$85/session** (first 3-5 clients) |
| **3×/week** | $80-$100/session | $960-$1,200/month | **$65-$80/session** (first 3-5 clients) |
| **4-5×/week** | $75-$95/session | $1,200-$1,900/month | Not recommended initially due to facility constraints |

**Volume Discounts:**
- 2+ sessions/week: 10% discount on monthly package
- 3+ sessions/week: 15% discount on monthly package

**Minnesota Market Positioning:**
- **Metro Area**: $90-$110/session (standard), $100-$120/session (premium)
- **Suburban/Rural**: $70-$90/session (standard), $85-$105/session (premium)

**Recommendation:**
- **Focus on Tier 1 (Remote) and Tier 2 (Hybrid) initially**

---

## Pricing Modifiers & Considerations

### Discounts & Adjustments
- **Sibling Discount**: 10% off second child, 15% off third+ children
- **Multi-Package Commitment**: 12.5% discount for booking 2+ seasonal packages upfront
- **Early Bird Pricing**: 5% additional discount for booking 30+ days before program start

### Credential-Based Premium
Given credentials (CSCS, NHSSCA, Speed & Agility Certification, 10 years experience, track record):
- **Average-to-Premium Pricing**: Position between 45-70th percentile within market range
- **Value Communication**: Emphasize certifications, NCAA athlete success stories, state qualifiers
- **Differentiation**: Highlight sport-specific expertise (track & field, S&C specialization)

---

## Pricing Psychology & Positioning

### Value Anchoring
- Always present packages in order: Premium → Standard → Basic (anchors high value)
- Show "value" of included assessments, support, etc. (e.g., "$200 initial assessment included")
- Compare to cost of private coaching elsewhere ($90-110/session × frequency)

### Scarcity & Urgency
- Limited spots per package (e.g., "Only 8 spots available for Summer Development")
- Early registration deadlines with pricing tiers
- "Seasonal windows" messaging (offseason is prime development time)

### Guarantees (from [[$100M Offers]])
- **Results Guarantee**: If athlete follows program and doesn't see improvement in key metrics (strength, speed, performance), offer 2 additional sessions free
- **Satisfaction Guarantee**: If not satisfied after first 2 weeks, refund remaining package (minus trial session if used)

---

## Programming Frequency Options

### Most Common (4-5×/week)
**Standard pricing tier** - This is the baseline for package pricing

### Less Frequent (3×/week)
- 15-20% discount from standard tier
- Good for: Multi-sport athletes, beginners, budget-conscious families

### High Frequency (6×/week)
- 10-15% premium over standard tier
- Good for: Elite athletes, single-sport focus, peak development phases

---

## Sample Revenue Projections

### Example: Summer Development Package
**Scenario**: 10 athletes enrolled

| Package Type | Athletes | Price | Total Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Remote Only | 4 | $1,912 avg ($1,350-$2,475 range) | $7,650 |
| Hybrid Standard | 4 | $2,498 avg ($2,160-$2,835 range) | $9,990 |
| Hybrid Premium | 2 | $3,375 avg ($2,970-$3,780 range) | $6,750 |
| **Total** | **10** | - | **$24,390** |

**With Upsells** (assuming 50% take add-ons):
- Nutrition coaching: 5 athletes × $150 × 3 months = $2,250
- Recruiting support: 2 athletes × $200 = $400
- **Additional Revenue**: $2,650
- **Grand Total**: $23,050

---

## Next Steps & Implementation

1. **Survey Local Competition**: Verify these ranges against local MN competitors
2. **Create Pricing Sheet**: Professional one-pager with tiers, packages, and value props
3. **Set Up Payment Processing**: Stripe/PayPal for online payments, payment plans
4. **Develop Offer Sequences**: Scripts for attraction, upsells, downsells, continuity
5. **Test & Adjust**: Start with mid-range pricing, adjust based on demand and feedback

**5. Continuity & Long-term Development**
- Your seasonal package structure builds long-term athlete relationships
- Better integration with sport coaching roles (understanding athlete's full development picture)
- Recruiting support and college prep add-ons (unique value for high school athletes)

### Positioning Strategy for ETS-Aware Athletes

**Value Conversation Starters:**
- "Like ETS's data-driven approach? We offer similar performance tracking with more personalized attention and flexibility."
- "Instead of facility visits 2-4×/week, get customized programming you can do on your schedule, plus regular check-ins."
- "We specialize in offseason development with seasonal packages designed around your competitive calendar."

**Pricing Discussion Points:**
- **If athlete inquires about ETS comparison**: "ETS uses small-group facility training, which works great if you're close to a facility and prefer in-person coaching. Our remote/hybrid model offers similar programming quality with more flexibility, and we can work within your budget with different tier options."
- **Value Positioning**: "What you're paying for at ETS includes facility overhead. Our model passes those savings to you while still providing professional programming and coaching support."
- **Differentiation**: "Think of it as ETS-quality programming, but delivered in a way that fits your schedule and location. Plus, with our seasonal packages, you're getting dedicated offseason development tailored to your sport and competition calendar."

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Acknowledge their ETS experience positively** - validates their investment in training
2. **Highlight complementary benefits** - flexibility, personalization, offseason focus
3. **Offer trial or assessment** - similar to ETS's free evaluation, but focused on determining best fit for your services
4. **Position as value alternative or premium upgrade** depending on your pricing relative to ETS (to be determined through market research)

### Pricing Implications

**If ETS pricing is similar to your ranges ($300-$600/month for hybrid):**
- Emphasize value: more flexible, personalized, offseason-focused
- Highlight convenience and time savings
- Focus on sport coaching integration and recruiting support

**If ETS pricing is higher ($600-$1,000+/month):**
- Position as premium alternative at competitive price point
- Emphasize similar quality (data-driven, certified coaching) at better value
- Use ETS pricing as anchor for your premium tier positioning

**If ETS pricing is lower ($200-$400/month):**
- Emphasize personalization and convenience benefits
- Highlight that small-group format limits individual attention
- Focus on ROI: better results through more personalized coaching

**Unknown Variable**: Since ETS doesn't publish pricing, ask athletes who have experience with them about:
- Monthly investment they were making
- What they liked/didn't like about the model
- Why they're looking for alternatives (if applicable)
- What value they most appreciated (data tracking, structure, coaching, etc.)

## Pricing Strategy Adjustments Based on Context

### Recommended Initial Pricing (First 3-5 Clients)

**"Founding Member" Pricing Strategy:**
- Offer **10-15% discount** on all tiers for first 3-5 clients
- Position as "building proof" and "early adopter" benefit
- Set clear expectation: Rates will increase to market pricing after building client base
- Use early clients to generate testimonials, case studies, and referrals

**Focus Areas (Priority Order):**
1. **Tier 1: Remote Coaching** - Primary focus, plays to strengths, no constraints
2. **Tier 2: Hybrid Coaching** - Secondary focus, balanced approach, flexible delivery
3. **Tier 3: 1:1 In-Person** - Minimal focus initially, offer as occasional add-on

**Value Positioning:**
- Emphasize: "Certified High School Strength & Conditioning Coach" (not CPT)
- Highlight: Programming expertise and track record with team athletes
- Focus: Offseason development and sport-specific preparation
- Differentiate: Flexible remote/hybrid model fits athlete schedules

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Facility Issue**: De-emphasize 1:1, focus on remote/hybrid
- **Limited Experience**: Start with lower pricing, build proof before raising rates
- **No Client Base**: Use "founding member" pricing to attract early adopters
- **Side Hustle**: Position as premium, focused service rather than volume-based
