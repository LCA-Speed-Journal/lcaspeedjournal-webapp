# Phase 0 — Value Prop, Selling to Admin, Setup
## Value Proposition and Selling to Admin
*Prerequisite to building out this project, need to sell administration on the following:*
- Pricing Model (revenue split rather than stipend)
- Control over the project
- Narrowed to the specified scope (only as extracurricular in the first year, will not be partnering with gym class)
## Setup
*Purchasing and installing equipment in the weightroom. Currently, no equipment installed, just an empty room on the site-plan.*
- Purchasing Weight-Room Components from Equipment-Vendors
	- Current Cost-Estimate — $40,000 for functional equipment, not a finished state but a functional one
- Blocking out Space in the Room
	- 1,000 sq-ft, 5:4 aspect ratio.
- Installing and Securing School-Purchased Equipment
	- 2x Full-Racks (arranged as Rig, so connected by a pull-up bar)
	- 1x Deadlift Platform
	- 4x Barbells
	- Iron Plates and Bumper Plates
	- 5-100lb Dumbbells
	- 3x Adjustable Benches
	- 1x Functional Trainer
	- 1x Dip-Station
	- 1x Plyobox Set
# Phase 1A — Pilot Group
*Opening up the weightroom to staff and alumni before testing with actual students, as they’re more forgiving of a new initiative due to increased training age and understanding of the process of building out a new program.*
- Implement a “summer camp” open to current staff and recent alumni
	- 3-4x p/wk, 60min sessions
	- Alternate idea to accommodate staff with tighter schedules who still want to participate — “Staff Saturdays,” where we target total-body 1x p/wk.
# Phase 1B — School-Year
*The first class of weight-room students. Limiting to Grades 9-12, or anyone on a JV/Varsity team.*
## Fall
*The first group for the year, going to be the most apprehensive about integrating.*
### In-Season Sports
- Soccer
- Volleyball
- Cross Country
### Out of Season Offering
- 10wk Program (start ~3wks into school year, continue until start of 2wk winter break)
## Winter
*The most established time-frame, as the only active sport is basketball.*
### In-Season Sports
- Basketball
### Out of Season Offering
- 10wk Program (start after winter break, continue to start of 2wk spring break)
### Winter Speed Development
- 2x p/wk add-on program, over a shorter time-period than the traditional out-of-season offering (maybe 6wks)
## Spring
*The most likely time-frame for enrollments, as spring sports aren’t as popular as fall/winter ones.*
### In-Season Sports
- Track & Field
- Baseball
### Out of Season Offering
- 10wk Program (start after spring break, continue to summer break)
# Phase 2 — Summer Camps
*Opening up two summer camps for athletes, one for staff/alumni.*
## Summer All-In Program
*The flagship strength program over the summer. Offered 4x p/wk, training strength, speed, power, and athleticism, utilizing the full capability of our staff to emphasize well-rounded development for committed athltes.*
## Summer Strength
*A program focused on building foundational understanding of weightlifting for middle-school and high-school. Structured as a less-demanding form of our all-in program, only lifting 3x p/wk, focusing total-body each time.*
## Lions for Life
*A program offered to staff and alumni, designed to support our community members even after graduating. 2-3x p/wk, focused on well-rounded development but at an easier pace.*
# Phase 3 — Year-2 (Plans)
- Found a powerlifting club
- Host a strength-focused fundraiser (Lift-a-Thon, etc)
- Apply for NHSSCA Program of Excellence (must hold the standards before application)
