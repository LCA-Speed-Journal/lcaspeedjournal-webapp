# Slide 1 — Introduction

## Overview of the Business Concept

A **risk-free, percentage-based strength & conditioning program** that delivers professional coaching to student-athletes at 97-98% less cost than a full-time coordinator (or 88-90% less than a stipend-based model), with minimal financial risk for the school.

**Revenue Distribution Model:**
- **Coaches (Head + Assistant)**: 75% of total program revenue
- **School Facility/Overhead**: 10% of total program revenue  
- **Program Fund (Future Expansions)**: 15% of total program revenue

## Purpose of the Presentation

To present a partnership opportunity that:
- Provides professional S&C coaching to student-athletes
- Eliminates financial risk for the school through percentage-based revenue sharing
- Delivers proven results with certified coaching expertise
- Creates a scalable, sustainable program model

## What Problem the Business/Initiative Aims to Solve

**For Schools:**
- High cost of full-time S&C coordinators ($50,000-$75,000 annually)
- Financial risk of fixed-cost staffing models
- Lack of affordable, professional S&C programming for student-athletes
- Need for scalable solution that adapts to enrollment

**For Athletes & Families:**
- High cost of private training facilities ($1,260-$1,800 for 12 weeks)
- Lack of convenient, school-based S&C options
- Need for professional coaching with proven track record
- Desire for structured, periodized programming

---

# Slide 2 — Market Problem

## Current Challenges in the Market

**School Challenges:**
- **Full-Time Coordinator**: $50,000-$75,000 annual cost (fixed, regardless of results)
- **Stipend-Based Model**: $9,000 annually with budget risk if enrollment is low
- Limited budget flexibility for athletic programs
- Fixed costs create financial burden regardless of program success

**Athlete/Family Challenges:**
- **Private Facilities**: $35-$50/session = $1,260-$1,800 for 12 weeks
- **Club Sports**: $1,200-$3,000+ per season
- Commercial gyms offer no professional coaching
- Travel and scheduling conflicts with school activities

## Inefficiencies or Unmet Customer Needs

- Schools need professional S&C but can't afford full-time coordinators
- Athletes need affordable, convenient access to quality coaching
- Existing solutions are either too expensive or lack professional expertise
- No risk-sharing model that protects schools while incentivizing coaches

## Why Existing Solutions are Not Enough

**Full-Time Coordinator:**
- High fixed cost ($50,000-$75,000)
- No enrollment dependency (paid regardless of participation)
- Limited scalability

**Stipend-Based Add-On:**
- Fixed per-term payment ($3,000/term = $9,000/year)
- Budget risk if enrollment doesn't justify cost
- Staff bandwidth limitations

**Private Facilities:**
- Too expensive for most families ($1,260-$1,800 for 12 weeks)
- Requires travel and additional scheduling
- Not integrated with school athletic programs
