**Athlete:** Gabe Imm  
**Program Period:** January 26 - March 22, 2026 (8 weeks)

---
## Program Overview
### Main Goals
This 8-week program is designed to:
- **Build foundational strength** in essential movement patterns
- **Teach proper technique** and movement quality
- **Develop independence** and self-motivation in training / **Build long-term interest** in physical activity and strength training
### Training Philosophy
The programming approach emphasizes **learning** and **practicing** proper movement patterns. The program is structured to gradually build Gabe's ability to execute training sessions independently while maintaining proper form and technique.

---
## Training Structure
### Weekly Schedule
- **4 training sessions per week** total
- **2 in-person sessions** with coach (45-60 minutes each)
- **2 independent sessions** using the provided program → [[Upper-A — Gabe Imm 8wk]], [[Lower — Gabe Imm 8wk]], [[Upper-B — Gabe Imm 8wk]], [[Total — Gabe Imm 8wk]] (folder: `Client Work & Templates/Gabe Imm — 8-Week Workouts/`). By-week view: [[8-Week Microcycle Index — Gabe Imm]].
- **3 rest days** per week for recovery
### Session Breakdown
Each training session includes:
1. **Warm-up & Movement Preparation** - Mobility work, activation, and **neural drills** (e.g. drop-catches, ISOs) to prepare the body and develop coordination
2. **Athletic Movement Patterns** - Light athletic work (dynamic drills, jumps, med-ball work) to maintain well-roundedness
3. **Main Strength Work** - Foundational resistance training movements (squat, hinge, push, pull patterns); rep schemes: 3×12–15 (W1), 3×10 (W2), then 4×8 and beyond from Week 3+; AMRAPs built in for Weeks 3–6
4. **Secondaries** - Isolated lifts that complement the main lifts (e.g. single-arm row, shoulder press, hamstring curl, step-up)
5. **Accessories / Structure** - Underutilized areas: lower-leg, core, hip complex, stability, and injury-resilience work

## Daily Session Overview
### What Happens in Each Session
**1. Warm-up & Movement Prep (10-15 minutes)**
- Mobility work to prepare joints and muscles
- Activation exercises to "turn on" the body
- **Neural drills** for coordination (e.g. drop-catches, ISO holds in key positions)
- Dynamic movements to increase body temperature
**2. Athletic Movement Patterns (5-10 minutes)**
- Light explosive work to maintain well-rounded development:
	  - Jump variations (box jumps, broad jumps, lateral bounds)
	  - Med-ball drills (throws, slams, rotational work)
**3. Main Strength Work (20-25 minutes)**
- Primary foundational movements:
	- **Upper Body Days:** Push and pull patterns (bench, row, press variations)
	- **Lower Body Days:** Squat and hinge patterns (squat, deadlift variations)
	- **Total Body Days:** Combination of movements
- Focus on building strength in traditional resistance training patterns
**4. Secondaries (complement main lifts)**
- Isolated lifts that support the primary movement patterns of the day

**5. Accessories / Structure (10-15 minutes total with secondaries)**
- Lower-leg, core, hip complex, stability
- Addresses underutilized areas and injury prevention
#### **Total Session Time:** 50-60 minutes

## Program Phases
### Phase 1: Weeks 1-2 — Foundation & Learning
**Focus:** Learning proper movement patterns and building a solid base
**What to Expect:**
- More **teaching and guidance** during in-person sessions
- Emphasis on **learning** correct form for foundational movements
- Building movement awareness and self-awareness
**Coach's Role:** Heavy emphasis on teaching, demonstrating, and providing feedback  
**Athlete's Role:** Focus on learning, asking questions, and practicing movements correctly

---
### Phase 2: Weeks 3-6 — Progressive Development
**Focus:** Building strength while maintaining movement quality
**What to Expect:**
- **Practicing** progressive loading with proper technique
- **Learning** to self-regulate intensity and effort
- Slightly increased training demands as the body adapts
- Athlete begins taking more ownership of warmup and session execution
**Coach's Role:** Continued guidance with gradual shift toward athlete independence  
**Athlete's Role:** Taking more initiative in session execution, applying learned movements

---
### Phase 3: Weeks 7-8 — Integration & Preparation
**Focus:** Applying learned movements independently and wrapping up the 8wk program
**What to Expect:**
- **Applying** learned movements with greater independence
- Athlete demonstrates ability to execute sessions properly on their own
**Coach's Role:** Oversight and fine-tuning, ensuring readiness
**Athlete's Role:** Demonstrating self-motivation and independent execution

---
## Assessment & Progress Tracking
### Pre-Test (Week 1)
- Force Dynamometry Assessment (Upper and Lower Body)
- Establishes baseline strength levels, potential imbalances
### Post-Test (Week 8)
- Force Dynamometry Assessment (Upper and Lower Body)
- Measures progress over the 8-week period
- Provides data for future training decisions

---
## Special Considerations
### Spring Sports Transition
The final 2 weeks of the program (Weeks 7-8) align with spring break and the start of spring sports season.
	(March 9, 2026)
#### **If joining Track & Field:**
- Final 2 weeks will coordinate with team training schedule
- Team lifts 2× per week, so we'll adjust accordingly
#### **If joining Trap Shooting:**
- Program continues as scheduled
- No anticipated conflicts with team training
### Flexibility & Support
- Additional in-person help available, particularly during early-weeks
- Particularly helpful as Gabe is learning and acclimating to the program
- Open communication encouraged if questions or concerns arise
