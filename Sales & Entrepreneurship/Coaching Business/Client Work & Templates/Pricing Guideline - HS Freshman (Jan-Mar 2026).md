## Recommended Service Tier

### Primary Recommendation: **Hybrid Standard** (with flexibility to adjust)

**Rationale:**
1. **Flexibility for uncertain needs**: Hybrid model allows starting with more programming focus, with option to add in-person sessions if needed
2. **ETS background**: Athlete is familiar with structured, quality programming; Hybrid provides similar value with more personalization
3. **Foundational development focus**: Weekly form checks ensure proper movement patterns as athlete transitions from ETS's supervised environment
4. **Short timeline**: 7 weeks is perfect for focused development block with regular accountability
5. **Nutritional guidance**: Can be included in Hybrid Standard tier without full nutrition coaching add-on

**Alternative Consideration:**
- **Remote Only** if parents prefer lower investment or athlete is highly self-motivated
- Can always upgrade to Hybrid if more support is needed

## Pricing Adjustments & Considerations

### Sibling Connection
- **Potential discount**: 10% sibling discount if sibling also becomes a client
- **Referral opportunity**: If sibling refers another athlete, both get benefits
- **Relationship leverage**: Use friendly relationship to build trust and demonstrate value

### ETS Background Considerations
- **Value anchor**: ETS's online coaching is $400-$1,000/month; your $600 package (7 weeks = ~$350/month equivalent) is competitive
- **Differentiation**: Emphasize flexibility, personalization, and foundational development focus
- **Transition support**: Position as helping athlete transition from supervised ETS environment to independent gym work

### Short Timeline (7 Weeks)
- **Positioning**: "Focused 7-week development block" rather than "short-term"
- **Value**: Emphasize that this is prime time for foundational work before spring season
- **Continuity**: Set expectation for re-evaluation post-season; potential for ongoing relationship

### Nutritional Guidance
- **Included in package**: Basic advice and recommendations (not full meal planning)
- **Upsell opportunity**: If parents want more detailed nutrition support, offer +$150/month add-on for full nutrition coaching
- **Positioning**: "Nutritional guidance to support training" rather than "nutrition coaching"

### Flexibility for Uncertain Service Level
- **Start with Hybrid Standard**: Provides structure with option to adjust
- **If athlete is highly self-motivated**: Can reduce to Remote Only and refund difference
- **If more support needed**: Can add additional 1:1 sessions at $75/session (founding member rate)

## Conversation Script Points

### Opening (After Evaluation)
"Based on the evaluation, I'd recommend a **7-week Hybrid Standard package** at $600. This gives you:
- Custom programming 4×/week tailored to foundational development
- Weekly form checks to ensure proper movement as you transition from ETS's supervised environment
- Regular check-ins to keep you motivated and accountable
- Basic nutritional guidance to support your training
- All designed to get you ready for spring season and build a foundation for long-term physical activity"

### Addressing ETS Comparison
"Since you've been with ETS, you're familiar with structured, quality programming. Our approach is similar in terms of programming quality, but we offer more personalized attention and flexibility. ETS's online coaching runs $400-$1,000/month; this 7-week package works out to about $350/month, and it's specifically designed for your timeline and goals."

### Addressing Budget Concerns
"If the Hybrid package is more than you're looking for, we can start with **Remote Only at $400** for the 7 weeks. That gives you the programming and check-ins, and we can always add in-person sessions later if needed. Or we can do **Hybrid Light at $500** with bi-weekly form checks instead of weekly."

### Addressing Service Level Uncertainty
"The Hybrid Standard package gives you flexibility - we start with weekly form checks, but if you're doing great on your own, we can reduce those. If you need more support, we can add sessions. The goal is to find what works best for you while building that foundation."

### Post-Season Continuity
"After spring season starts, we'll re-evaluate based on your sport participation and schedule. If you join a team, we can adjust to a maintenance program. If you're not doing a spring sport, we can continue with development work. Either way, we'll make sure the programming fits your situation."

## Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **Flexibility**: Unlike ETS's facility-based model, training happens at athlete's preferred location/time
2. **Personalization**: More individualized attention than small-group ETS format
3. **Foundational Focus**: Specifically designed for building long-term interest and proper movement patterns
4. **Timeline-Specific**: 7-week package tailored to pre-season window
5. **Transition Support**: Helps athlete move from supervised ETS environment to independent gym work
6. **Relationship**: Friendly connection through sibling builds trust

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete evaluation** this week to establish baseline and confirm programming needs
2. **Present pricing** using Hybrid Standard as primary recommendation
3. **Address questions** about service level, ETS comparison, and post-season plans
4. **Confirm package** and payment method
5. **Begin programming** within 48 hours of commitment
6. **Schedule weekly form checks** (flexible timing based on athlete's schedule)

---

## Notes

- This is a **founding member** client, so pricing is 10-15% below full market rates
- **7 weeks** is slightly longer than Preseason Package (6 weeks) but shorter than Winter Package (8 weeks)
- Pricing is based on **4×/week** standard tier; if frequency changes, adjust accordingly
- **Nutritional guidance** is included as basic advice; full nutrition coaching would be +$150/month add-on
- **Post-season re-evaluation** is important - set clear expectations about potential continuation
- **Sibling connection** provides relationship leverage and potential referral opportunity
