# Evaluation Protocol: High School Freshman (45-60 Minutes)

## Purpose
Initial movement assessment to establish baseline, identify movement patterns, assess current capabilities, and inform programming decisions for the 7-week preseason block.

## Athlete Context
- High School Freshman
- 1.5 years training experience with ETS Performance
- Transitioning from supervised ETS environment to independent gym work
- Goal: Foundational development to build interest in physical activity
- Timeline: ~7 weeks until spring season (March 9, 2026)

---

## Session Structure (45-60 Minutes)

### Phase 1: Introduction & Movement History (5-8 minutes)
**Purpose:** Build rapport, understand training background, identify goals and concerns

**Conversation Points:**
- Training history with ETS (what they liked, what they found challenging)
- Current activity level and any time off
- Spring sport considerations (Track or Trap-Shooting)
- Any injuries, limitations, or areas of concern
- Goals for the 7-week block
- Comfort level with independent training vs. supervised sessions

**Key Questions:**
- "What did you enjoy most about training at ETS?"
- "What movements or exercises felt most challenging?"
- "Are there any movements that cause discomfort or you avoid?"
- "What's your experience level with basic lifts (squat, deadlift, pressing)?"

---

### Phase 2: Movement Screen & Pattern Assessment (15-20 minutes)
**Purpose:** Identify movement quality, restrictions, and compensation patterns

#### A. Basic Movement Patterns (8-10 minutes)
**Assess quality, not load:**
1. **Squat Pattern** (Bodyweight)
   - Overhead Squat (with PVC or dowel)
   - Goblet Squat (light load, 10-15lb)
   - Look for: Ankle mobility, hip mobility, core stability, knee tracking

2. **Hinge Pattern** (Bodyweight)
   - Romanian Deadlift (RDL) pattern
   - Single-Leg RDL (balance + mobility assessment)
   - Look for: Hamstring flexibility, hip mobility, core control, balance

3. **Lunge Pattern** (Bodyweight)
   - Forward Lunge (both legs)
   - Reverse Lunge
   - Look for: Hip mobility, stability, balance, symmetry

4. **Push Pattern** (Bodyweight)
   - Push-Up (full or modified)
   - Look for: Upper body strength, core stability, shoulder mobility

5. **Pull Pattern** (Bodyweight or light band)
   - Inverted Row or Band Row
   - Look for: Upper back strength, shoulder stability

#### B. Mobility & Stability Quick Checks (5-7 minutes)
1. **Ankle Mobility**
   - Knee-to-wall test (dorsiflexion)
   - Calf flexibility check

2. **Hip Mobility**
   - Hip Flexor Test (Thomas Test position)
   - Internal/External Rotation (seated or supine)

3. **Core Stability**
   - Plank Hold (30-60s)
   - Side Plank (20-30s each side)
   - Single-Leg Stand (balance test, 30s each)

4. **Shoulder Mobility**
   - Overhead Reach (both arms)
   - Shoulder External Rotation (band or bodyweight)

**Note:** Document restrictions, asymmetries, and areas needing attention

---

### Phase 3: Performance Testing (15-20 minutes)
**Purpose:** Establish baseline metrics for power, speed, and strength

#### A. Power Assessment (5-7 minutes)
1. **Countermovement Jump (CMJ)**
   - 2-3 attempts
   - Measure: Height (if jump mat available) or visual assessment
   - Look for: Landing mechanics, symmetry, power output

2. **Standing Broad Jump**
   - 2-3 attempts
   - Measure: Distance
   - Look for: Horizontal power, landing mechanics

3. **Med-Ball Overhead Throw** (if space/equipment available)
   - 2-3 attempts
   - Measure: Distance
   - Look for: Total body power, coordination

#### B. Speed Assessment (5-7 minutes)
1. **10-15m Acceleration**
   - 2-3 attempts (standing start)
   - Measure: Time (if timing gates available) or visual assessment
   - Look for: Acceleration mechanics, posture, drive phase

2. **30m Sprint** (if space allows)
   - 1-2 attempts
   - Measure: Time
   - Look for: Transition to max velocity, mechanics

#### C. Strength Indicators (5-6 minutes)
**Note:** Not testing 1RM, but assessing movement quality and relative strength

1. **Goblet Squat** (with moderate load)
   - 5-8 reps
   - Assess: Form quality, depth, stability
   - Progressive loading to find comfortable working weight

2. **RDL or Romanian Deadlift Pattern**
   - 5-8 reps (bodyweight or light load)
   - Assess: Hip hinge mechanics, hamstring engagement

3. **Push-Up or Incline Push-Up**
   - Max reps (or to form failure)
   - Assess: Upper body strength baseline

4. **Pull-Up or Inverted Row**
   - Max reps (or to form failure)
   - Assess: Upper body pulling strength

**Alternative:** If time is limited, focus on movement quality over max reps

---

### Phase 4: Isometric Testing (Optional, 5-8 minutes)
**Purpose:** Assess force production capacity in key movement patterns

**If Voltra or similar equipment available:**
- **Ankle Dorsiflexion** (RSIST) — 1x 5s test per leg
- **Adduction** — 1x 5s test per leg
- **Hamstring Curl** (if equipment available) — 1x 5s test per leg

**If equipment not available:**
- Skip this section or use manual resistance tests
- Focus on movement quality from Phase 2 instead

---

### Phase 5: Discussion & Next Steps (5-8 minutes)
**Purpose:** Summarize findings, discuss programming approach, answer questions

**Key Points to Cover:**
1. **Strengths Identified**
   - What the athlete does well
   - Areas of good movement quality

2. **Areas for Development**
   - Movement restrictions or compensations
   - Strength imbalances
   - Technical improvements needed

3. **Programming Approach**
   - How findings will inform programming
   - Focus areas for the 7-week block
   - Frequency and structure (4×/week standard)

4. **Address Questions**
   - Service level (1:1 vs. programming)
   - Training schedule and logistics
   - Nutrition guidance (basic advice included)

5. **Transition to Pricing Discussion**
   - Reference the evaluation as part of the package value
   - Present Hybrid Standard package recommendation
   - Address any concerns or questions

---

## Equipment Needed

### Essential
- Open space for movement (gym floor or turf)
- Light weights (10-15lb dumbbells or kettlebells)
- PVC pipe or dowel (for overhead squat)
- Resistance band (for pull assessment)
- Measuring tape (for broad jump)
- Stopwatch or timing device

### Optional but Helpful
- Jump mat (for CMJ height measurement)
- Timing gates (for sprint times)
- Med-ball (for overhead throw)
- Voltra or similar isometric testing device
- Foam roller (for mobility assessment)

---

## What to Look For & Document

### Movement Quality Indicators
- **Ankle Mobility:** Can they achieve full dorsiflexion? Knee-over-toe position in squat?
- **Hip Mobility:** Full range in squat? Symmetrical in lunges?
- **Core Stability:** Can they maintain neutral spine under load? Control in single-leg positions?
- **Shoulder Mobility:** Full overhead reach? Proper scapular positioning?
- **Balance:** Symmetrical single-leg stability? Any significant left/right differences?

### Performance Indicators
- **Power:** CMJ height, broad jump distance
- **Speed:** Acceleration mechanics, 30m time (if measured)
- **Strength:** Relative strength in basic patterns, working weight tolerance

### Red Flags
- Pain during any movement
- Significant asymmetries (left vs. right)
- Major movement restrictions that limit basic patterns
- Poor landing mechanics (high injury risk)
- Inability to perform basic bodyweight movements

## Time Management Tips

**If running short on time (45 minutes):**
- Prioritize movement screen (Phase 2) — most important for programming
- Reduce performance testing to 1-2 key metrics (CMJ + one sprint)
- Skip isometric testing or make it very brief
- Shorten discussion but ensure key points are covered

**If you have full time (60 minutes):**
- Complete all phases thoroughly
- Include isometric testing if equipment available
- More detailed conversation about goals and programming
- Can add additional movement variations or drills

---
