**Session type:** Total Body (Deadlift + Upper + Lunge)  
**Use on:** Total body day of the week (e.g. Friday).  
**Total time:** 50–60 minutes.

**How to run:** Move through each section in order. Warm-up & Movement Prep (10–15 min) blends lower and upper. Athletic Movement Patterns: resisted sprints or MB throws if you have space (5–10 min). Main A (hinge) is straight sets; Main B (push/pull) is a superset. Weeks 3–6 include 1×AMRAP on Main A. Secondaries: lunge and inverted row. Accessories/Structure: core, lower-leg, grip (Dead Hang). If form breaks, stop and note it.
