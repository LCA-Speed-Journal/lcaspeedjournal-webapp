# Upper-A — Weeks 7–8: BB Bench (Integration & Preparation)

**Parent template:** [[Upper-A — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 7–8  
**Outline alignment:** **Integration & Preparation** — applying learned movements with greater independence; wrapping up the 8-week program; demonstrating you can execute sessions properly on your own. Week 8 may be lighter if post-test (Force Dynamometry) falls in the same week.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same session flow (Warm-up including drop-in during bench prep → Main → Secondaries → Accessories) and exercise order. You’re still doing BB Bench + Row, same secondaries and accessories. Nothing new to learn—just apply what you’ve built.

**New / progressing:** Volume tapers (4×8 → 3×8). **No AMRAP** so you finish fresh and show you can run the session without coach oversight. Week 8: keep 3×8 or go slightly lighter if you have the post-test that week. The goal is readiness and independence, not a new PR.
