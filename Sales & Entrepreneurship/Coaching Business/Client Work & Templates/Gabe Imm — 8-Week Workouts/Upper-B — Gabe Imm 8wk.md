# Upper-B — Gabe Imm (8-Week Program)

**Session type:** Upper Body (Pull-Focused)  
**Use on:** Second upper day of the week (e.g. Thursday).  
**Total time:** 50–60 minutes.

**How to run:** Move through each section in order. Warm-up & Movement Prep (10–15 min), then Athletic Movement Patterns if time (5–10 min). **Main A (Lat Pulldown):** do straight sets first—lat pulldowns are mid-gym at the machines. **Main B (Press + Row):** superset shoulder press and row in the free-weight area (30–45 s between exercises, 2–3 min between rounds). Secondaries: pair as supersets or circuits. Accessories/Structure: core, lower-leg. If form breaks, stop and note it.
