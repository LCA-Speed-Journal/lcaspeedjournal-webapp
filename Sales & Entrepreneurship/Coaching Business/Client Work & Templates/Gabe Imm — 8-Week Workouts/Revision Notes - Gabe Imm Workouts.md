# Revision Notes — Gabe Imm Workout Templates

**Purpose:** General design notes to apply when revising [[Upper-A — Gabe Imm 8wk]], [[Upper-B — Gabe Imm 8wk]], [[Lower — Gabe Imm 8wk]], and [[Total — Gabe Imm 8wk]].

---

## 1. Rep Scheme (Main Lifts)

- **Current:** Standard 3×10 used across most of the program.
- **Direction:** 3×10 is acceptable for **Weeks 1–2** (foundation/learning), but it should **progress out** from **Week 3 onward**—avoid leaving it as the default “cookie-cutter” scheme for the whole block.
- **Implied changes:** Vary or progress rep schemes in Weeks 3–8 (e.g. 4×8, 3×8, wave loading, or other progressions) so the program doesn’t stay locked on 3×10.

---

## 2. AMRAPs

- **Keep:** AMRAPs starting at **Week 3** are desirable.
- **Direction:** Retain and, where it makes sense, clarify or slightly expand their role in the mid-phase (Weeks 3–6) so they’re a consistent part of the progression, not just “optional.”

---

## 3. Supporting Exercises — Two Categories

Supporting work should be split into:

### Secondaries
- **Role:** More isolated lifts that **complement** the main lifts.
- **Examples:** Single-arm row after a main row; shoulder press after bench; hamstring curl or split-stance work after squat/hinge.
- **Programming:** Prescribed as distinct exercises with sets/reps, clearly tied to the main movement pattern of the day.

### Accessories / Structure
- **Role:** Underutilized areas and “structure” work—not primary movers.
- **Focus:** Lower-leg, core, hip complex, stability, injury resilience.
- **Examples:** Calf raises, tibialis work, ankle mobility; planks, dead bugs, rollout, anti-rotation; hip work (e.g. clams, band walks, 90/90), mini-band work.
- **Programming:** Grouped under an “Accessories / Structure” (or similar) sub-section so they’re clearly separate from secondaries.

**Template change:** In each of the four sessions, replace a single “Supporting Exercises” block with:
1. **Secondaries** — complement the main lift(s).
2. **Accessories / Structure** — lower-leg, core, hip complex, etc.

## 4. Warm-up — Neural Drills for Coordination

- **Current:** Warm-up is mobility + activation (e.g. arm circles, band work, leg swings, bodyweight squats).
- **Add:** **Neural drills** to develop coordination, not just “get warm.”
- **Examples:** Drop-catches, ISOs (isometric holds in key positions), and other reactive/coordinative drills.
- **Placement:** Fit into the existing “Warm-up & Movement Preparation” (10–15 min) so they’re part of the standard flow; specify which drills pair with upper vs lower vs total-body sessions where relevant.

## Summary Checklist (for when editing templates)

- [x] **Rep scheme:** Weeks 1–2 can use 3×10; Weeks 3+ progress out (e.g. 4×8, 3×8, or other progression). *Applied to all four templates.*
- [x] **AMRAPs:** Maintain and reinforce from Week 3 (e.g. Weeks 3–6). *AMRAPs are now part of the progression, not optional.*
- [x] **Supporting work:** Split into **Secondaries** (isolated, complement main lifts) and **Accessories/Structure** (lower-leg, core, hip complex, etc.). *Applied to all four templates.*
- [x] **Warm-up:** Add neural drills (drop-catches, ISOs, etc.) for coordination within the existing warm-up block. *Applied to all four templates + outline.*

*Document created to guide revisions. Apply these notes across the four workout templates and the [[8-Week Training Outline - Gabe Imm]] session breakdown where it describes “Supporting Exercises” and “Warm-up & Movement Prep”.*
