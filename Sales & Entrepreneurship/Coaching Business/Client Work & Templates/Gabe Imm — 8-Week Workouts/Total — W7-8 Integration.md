# Total — Weeks 7–8: Deadlift Integration & Preparation

**Parent template:** [[Total — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 7–8  
**Outline alignment:** **Integration & Preparation** — applying learned movements with greater independence; wrapping up the 8-week program; demonstrating you can execute the total session on your own. Week 8 lighter if post-test same week. If joining Track & Field, W7–8 may be adjusted with the coach.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same movement (Traditional Deadlift), same Main B and secondaries/accessories. You’re not learning anything new—you’re proving you can run the total day solo.

**New / progressing:** Volume tapers: **3×6–8** on deadlift, **2–3 rounds** on Main B. **No AMRAP.** You finish fresh and show independence. Week 8: keep 3×6–8 or go slightly lighter if post-test that week. Goal is readiness and confidence. If you join Track & Field, coordinate with coach for any schedule changes.
