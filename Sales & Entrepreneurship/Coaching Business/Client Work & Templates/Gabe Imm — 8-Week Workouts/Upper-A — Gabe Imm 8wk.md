# Upper-A — Gabe Imm (8-Week Program)

**Session type:** Upper Body (Push-Focused)  
**Use on:** First upper day of the week (e.g. Monday).  
**Total time:** 50–60 minutes.

**How to run:** Move through each section in order. Do Warm-up & Movement Prep (10–15 min), then Athletic Movement Patterns if you have time (5–10 min). Main Strength Work: perform A and B as a superset (30–45 s rest between exercises, 2–3 min between rounds). Secondaries: pair as supersets or circuits. Accessories/Structure: lower-leg, core, etc. If form breaks on any set, stop and note it—quality over quantity.

## Microcycles (sub-templates)

Use these when you want a phase-specific view. Same session flow each time; only main work (and sometimes AMRAP) changes.

| Weeks | Sub-template | Outline phase |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| 1–3   | [[Upper-A — W1-3 DB Bench]] | Foundation (W1–2) → bridge to Progressive (W3) |
| 4–6   | [[Upper-A — W4-6 BB Bench Progressive]] | Progressive Development |
| 7–8   | [[Upper-A — W7-8 BB Bench Integration]] | Integration & Preparation |

## Week-by-Week Progression (Main Lifts)

| Weeks | Main A (Bench) | Main B (Row) | AMRAP (W3–6) |
|-------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1–3   | **DB Bench** — 3×12–15 (W1) / 3×10 (W2) @ RPE 7–8, 4×8 (W3) @ RPE 8 | 3×12–15 (W1) / 3×10 (W2) / 4×8 (W3+) @ RPE 7–8 | — (W1–2) / 1×AMRAP @ ~80% (W3+) |
| 4–6   | **BB Bench** — 4×8 @ RPE 8; add weight when form is solid | 4×8 @ RPE 8 | 1×AMRAP @ ~80% after last set |
| 7–8   | **BB Bench** — 3×8, then taper; Week 8 lighter if post-test same week | 3×8 | — |
