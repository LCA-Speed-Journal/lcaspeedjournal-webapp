# Lower — Weeks 3–5: Front Squat (Progressive Development)

**Parent template:** [[Lower — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 3–5  
**Outline alignment:** **Progressive Development** — building strength while keeping movement quality; new movement (front squat) builds on Goblet; practicing progressive loading; AMRAP introduced; more ownership of session execution.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same session flow (Warm-up → Athletic optional → Main → Secondaries → Accessories), same secondaries and accessories. You know the lower-day routine; you’re now applying it to a barbell squat.

**New / progressing:** Main squat is **Front Squat** — barbell on shoulders, elbows high, torso upright. New skill: rack position and upper-back bracing. 4×8 @ RPE 8; add weight when form is solid. **1×AMRAP Squat @ ~80%** after your last working set (W3–5).  You’re practicing “progressive loading” and “self-regulate intensity” (Outline). Next microcycle: Back Squat (W6–8).
