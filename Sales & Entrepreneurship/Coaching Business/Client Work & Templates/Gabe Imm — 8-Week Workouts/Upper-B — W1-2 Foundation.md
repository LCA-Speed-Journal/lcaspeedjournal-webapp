# Upper-B — Weeks 1–2: Foundation & Learning

**Parent template:** [[Upper-B — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 1–2  
**Outline alignment:** **Foundation & Learning** — learning proper movement patterns (vertical pull + press); building a solid base; emphasis on correct form; building movement awareness. No AMRAP yet.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same session flow (Warm-up → Main → Secondaries → Accessories). Upper-B has no separate Athletic Movement segment; you go from warm-up into main work. You’re building a second “upper day” routine. Main A is done at the lat station, then you move to free weights for Main B.

**New / progressing:** Main A is **Lat Pulldown** (full block—build quality here before chin-ups later). Main B is **DB Shoulder Press + DB Row** (or Cable Row) as a superset. Reps: 3×12–15 (W1) / 3×10 (W2) @ RPE 7–8 for both; 2–3 rounds on Main B. Focus is *learning* the pull to sternum/collarbone and tall pressing posture. No AMRAP; you’re establishing the pattern and RPE feel. Secondaries (Bicep–Tricep supersets, Lateral + Rear-delt) and Accessories/Structure stay the same for the whole block.

## Main Strength Work (this microcycle only)

| Weeks | Main A | Main B | AMRAP |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1–2   | Lat Pulldown 3×12–15 (W1) / 3×10 (W2) @ RPE 7–8 | DB Shoulder Press + DB Row (or Cable Row) 2–3 rounds × 12–15 (W1) / × 10 (W2) each | — |

*Rest:* Do all Lat Pulldown sets first, then move to free-weight area. Main B: 30–45 s between exercises in the superset, 2–3 min between rounds. If form breaks, stop and note it.
