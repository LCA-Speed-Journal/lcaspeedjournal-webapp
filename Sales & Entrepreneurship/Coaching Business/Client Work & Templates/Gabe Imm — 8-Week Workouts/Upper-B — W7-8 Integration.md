# Upper-B — Weeks 7–8: Integration & Preparation

**Parent template:** [[Upper-B — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 7–8  
**Outline alignment:** **Integration & Preparation** — applying learned movements with greater independence; wrapping up the 8-week program; demonstrating you can execute sessions on your own. Week 8 may be lighter if post-test same week.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same movements (Lat Pulldown, Main B Press + Row superset), same session flow (Warm-up → Main → Secondaries → Accessories) and secondaries/accessories. Nothing new—you’re proving you can run the pull-focused upper day solo.

**New / progressing:** Volume tapers: **3×8** for both main lifts. **No AMRAP.** You finish fresh and show independence. Week 8: keep 3×8 or go slightly lighter if post-test that week. Goal is readiness and confidence, not a new max.
