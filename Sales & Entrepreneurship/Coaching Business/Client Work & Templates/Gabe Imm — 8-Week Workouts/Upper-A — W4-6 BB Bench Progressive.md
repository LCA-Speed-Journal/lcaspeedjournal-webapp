# Upper-A — Weeks 4–6: BB Bench (Progressive Development)

**Parent template:** [[Upper-A — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 4–6  
**Outline alignment:** **Progressive Development** — building strength while keeping movement quality; practicing progressive loading; learning to self-regulate intensity; more ownership of session execution.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same session flow (Warm-up including drop-in during bench prep → Main → Secondaries → Accessories), same superset structure (bench + row), same secondaries and accessories. You know the routine; you’re now applying it to a new bar path and load.

**New / progressing:** Main horizontal push is **barbell bench**. New skill: bar path, hand width, and leg drive. You keep 4×8 @ RPE 8 and add weight when form stays solid. **AMRAP @ ~80%** after your last working set is part of every session—you’re practicing “progressive loading” and “self-regulate intensity” (Outline). Row stays 4×8 in parallel. By end of W6 you’ve had three weeks of barbell skill and loading; W7–8 will taper so you integrate and prepare for post-test.
