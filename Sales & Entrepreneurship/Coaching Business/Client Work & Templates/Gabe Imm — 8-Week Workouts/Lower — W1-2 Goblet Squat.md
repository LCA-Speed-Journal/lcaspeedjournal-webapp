# Lower — Weeks 1–2: Goblet Squat (Foundation & Learning)

**Parent template:** [[Lower — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 1–2  
**Outline alignment:** **Foundation & Learning** — learning the squat pattern and hinge in a low-risk way; building a solid base; emphasis on correct form (descent, drive knees out); building movement awareness. No AMRAP yet.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same session flow (Warm-up → Athletic Movement Patterns optional → Main → Secondaries → Accessories). Same secondaries (Step-Up, Glute Bridge, Hamstring Curl, Back Extension) and structure. You’re building the “lower day” routine.

**New / progressing:** Main squat is **Goblet Squat** — front load, arms friendly, easy to learn depth and torso position. 3×12–15 (W1) / 3×10 (W2) @ RPE 7–8. Focus is *learning* the pattern (descent, drive knees out). No AMRAP yet. Next microcycle you’ll move to Front Squat.
