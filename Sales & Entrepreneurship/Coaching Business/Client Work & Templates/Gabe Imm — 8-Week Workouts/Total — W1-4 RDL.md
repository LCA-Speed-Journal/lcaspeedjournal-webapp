# Total — Weeks 1–4: RDL (Foundation → Progressive)

**Parent template:** [[Total — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 1–4  
**Outline alignment:** **W1–2** = Foundation & Learning (learn hinge pattern, RPE 7–8, no AMRAP). **W3–4** = Progressive Development (4×8, AMRAP introduced; more ownership). Upper capacity (DB Bench + Row) builds from 2–3 rounds to 3 rounds.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same session flow (full-body warm-up, neural drills, Athletic Movement Patterns → Main A → Main B → Secondaries → Accessories). Same Main B superset (DB Bench + Row), same secondaries (Leg Extension, Forward to Reverse Lunge) and core/obliques/grip work. You’re building the “total day” routine.

**New / progressing:** Main A is **RDL** (DB or BB)—hinge at hips, neutral spine, hamstring stretch. Teaches the deadlift pattern without the pull from the floor. **W1–2:** 3×8–10 @ RPE 7–8, no AMRAP. **W3–4:** 4×8 @ RPE 8, **1×AMRAP RDL @ ~80%** after last set. Upper superset: 2–3 rounds (W1–2), 3 rounds (W3–4). Next microcycle you’ll move to traditional deadlift from the floor (W5–6).
