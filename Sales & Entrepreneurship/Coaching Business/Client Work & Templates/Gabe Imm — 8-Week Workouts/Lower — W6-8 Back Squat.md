# Lower — Weeks 6–8: Back Squat (Progressive → Integration)

**Parent template:** [[Lower — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 6–8  
**Outline alignment:** **W6** = Progressive Development (new movement, 4×8 + AMRAP). **W7–8** = Integration & Preparation — applying learned movements independently; taper volume; Week 8 lighter if post-test same week.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same session flow and secondaries/accessories. You’ve done Goblet and Front Squat; Back Squat uses the same lower-day structure with a new bar position.

**New / progressing:** Main squat is **Back Squat** — bar on upper back, new skill: shelf position and back angle. **W6:** 4×8 @ RPE 8 + 1×AMRAP @ ~80%. **W7–8:** Volume tapers to 3×8; AMRAP drops so you finish fresh. Week 8: keep 3×8 or go slightly lighter if post-test that week. Goal by W8 is independence and readiness, not a new max.
