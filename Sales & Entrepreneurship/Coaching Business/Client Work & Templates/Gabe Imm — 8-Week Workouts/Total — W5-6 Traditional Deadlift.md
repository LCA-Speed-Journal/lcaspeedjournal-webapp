# Total — Weeks 5–6: Traditional Deadlift (Progressive Development)

**Parent template:** [[Total — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 5–6  
**Outline alignment:** **Progressive Development** — new movement (conventional/traditional deadlift from floor); building strength while keeping movement quality; 4×8 + AMRAP; applying what RDL taught (hinge, spine, lockout).

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same session flow and Main B (DB Bench + Row), same secondaries (Leg Extension, Forward to Reverse Lunge) and accessories. You’ve done four weeks of RDL; you know the hinge and pull pattern. You’re adding the pull from the floor.

**New / progressing:** Main A is **Traditional/Conventional Deadlift** — bar from floor, neutral spine, hip hinge to lockout. New skill: setup, bracing, and leg drive off the floor. 4×8 @ RPE 8 + **1×AMRAP @ ~80%** after last set. Main B stays 3 rounds. You’re practicing “progressive loading” and “self-regulate intensity” (Outline). W7–8 will taper (no AMRAP, 3×6–8) for Integration.
