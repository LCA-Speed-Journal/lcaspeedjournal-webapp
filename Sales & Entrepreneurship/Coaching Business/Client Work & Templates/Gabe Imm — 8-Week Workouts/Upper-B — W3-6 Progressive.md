# Upper-B — Weeks 3–6: Progressive Development

**Parent template:** [[Upper-B — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 3–6  
**Outline alignment:** **Progressive Development** — building strength while keeping movement quality; practicing progressive loading; learning to self-regulate intensity; AMRAP introduced and maintained; more ownership of session execution.

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same movements—Lat Pulldown and Main B (DB Shoulder Press + DB Row superset). Same session flow (Warm-up → Main → Secondaries → Accessories), same secondaries and accessories. The “pull-focused upper day” is now your routine; you’re progressing it.

**New / progressing:** Rep scheme moves to **4×8** for both main lifts @ RPE 8. Add load when 4×8 is clean. **AMRAP @ ~80%** on Lat Pulldown after your last working set is part of every session (W3–6). You’re practicing “progressive loading” and “self-regulate intensity” (Outline). No movement change—just more demand and the new skill of pacing for an AMRAP. W7–8 will taper.

## Main Strength Work (this microcycle only)

| Weeks | Main A | Main B | AMRAP |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 3–4   | Lat Pulldown 4×8 @ RPE 8; add load when form is solid | DB Shoulder Press + DB Row 3 rounds × 8–10 each | 1×AMRAP Lat Pulldown @ ~80% after last set |
| 5–6   | Lat Pulldown 4×8 @ RPE 8 + 1×AMRAP | DB Shoulder Press + DB Row 3 rounds × 8 each | 1×AMRAP after last working set |

*Rest:* Do all Lat Pulldown sets first, then move to free-weight area. Main B: 30–45 s between exercises in the superset, 2–3 min between rounds. If form breaks, stop and note it.
