# Upper-A — Weeks 1–3: DB Bench (Foundation → Bridge to Progressive)

**Parent template:** [[Upper-A — Gabe Imm 8wk]]  
**Weeks:** 1–3  
**Outline alignment:** W1–2 = **Foundation & Learning** (learn patterns, RPE 7–8, no AMRAP). W3 = bridge into **Progressive Development** (4×8, first AMRAP introduced).

## This microcycle in context

**Familiar:** Same session flow: Warm-up (mobility, band rows, Deep Push-Up Hold, neural drills, plus Standing Push-Up Drop-In during bench prep) → Main → Secondaries → Accessories. Same main superset idea (push + pull). Same secondaries and structure. You're building a repeatable routine.

**New / progressing:** Main horizontal push is **dumbbell bench** — easier to learn symmetry and ROM than barbell. Weeks 1–2 focus on *learning* the pattern at 3×10 with 1–2 reps in reserve; Week 3 you add a set (4×8), dial intensity to RPE 8, and perform your first **AMRAP** at ~80% so you start practicing "leaving a little in the tank" then finishing strong. Row progresses in parallel. By end of W3 you're ready to move to barbell bench in the next microcycle.

## Main Strength Work (this microcycle only)

| Weeks | Main A | Main B | AMRAP |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1–2   | DB Bench 3×10 @ RPE 7–8 | Row 3×10 @ RPE 7–8 | — |
| 3     | DB Bench 4×8 @ RPE 8 | Row 4×8 @ RPE 8 | 1×AMRAP Bench @ ~80% after last set |

*Rest:* 30–45 s between exercises in the superset, 2–3 min between rounds. If form breaks, stop and note it.
