# Reflecting on Last Week
## Accomplishments 
- Got tees planned for the 2024-25 EMAC Title
	Materials ordered and shipped out — should be ready by Back-to-School Night.
- Attended Hormozi’s $100M Money Models Book-Launch: purchased the book-trilogy, picked up some bonuses along the way
	- Biggest one: 90 days free to [[Skool]], perhaps go try to create an online community
	- Also likely need to go look at [[GymLaunch]], particularly surrounding starting to coach for commission? Not sure how they deal with online coaches vs in-person gyms
- Finished the [[CPM Scheduling]] Intro Course (Module 1)
	(did not get it sent out for review yet, apprehension there, not sure where that’s coming from)
- Concept-Crafted for Jacque’s Group, he seems to like it (which is good)
## Gratitude 
**The Biggest Point of Pride: Both Twins are Off to College.** 
	May be the Proudest Coach-Moment of my career so far. 
	They’ve both worked so hard, and for Sophia in particular to actually be going on scholarship, is *huge.*
## Health
### Weights
Hit 2 Days of Upper-Clusters, 2 days of UNIT-Style Lower. 
	Sprinted on Tu, Plyos on Fri.
- Hang Power-Clean is going up, 4x4 @ 195 was nice. Chipping up towards 225 for Hang-PWR Reps.
- Sprints felt mediocre, but Plyos are getting better (repeat-hop variations)
	- Need to start adding in **Spring-Ankle** for Accessories
	- Need to start adding **Step-Ups** for Secondaries
	- Need to start adding **Hip-Lifts** for Prehab
