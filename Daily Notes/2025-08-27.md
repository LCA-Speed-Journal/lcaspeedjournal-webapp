“Running is like a Mountain. There’s a limit for trees and on the top, air is a little bit thinner than it is at the bottom. That’s when you know you’ve succeeded.” -Jakob Ingibritson
## Minor Tasking 
## Reading Log 
### [[Randy Huntington]] Recording
- Younger athletes don’t knoe where their bodies are in space: need to help teach them proprioception
- When teaching Su: needed to learn how to send kneecaps down the track (more horiz. force, not as vertical). 
	- LILA Sleeves for Calves: started up higher, just below knee, to bring awareness
	- Su started casting, so sleeves needed to come further down as time went on
- Idea of “Horizontal Load” vs “Vertical Load”
	- Horizontal: load applied when body is moving (i.e. a sled)
	- Vertical: load applied to whole body (i.e. weight on frame)
- When loading the limb, less is more.
- Power can increase from two angles: strength-sided, and velocity-sided.
	- Which one do you need for your specific application?
