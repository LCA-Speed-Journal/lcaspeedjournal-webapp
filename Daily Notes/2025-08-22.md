# SD Monthly
- Tactile “what do I do with this” – creating Storyline files of “idea components” 
	- Taking time when time is available to play on mechanics, and put them in a component piece, sav it somewhere to then be repurposed later
- Reach out to Eric and Paul – **they** have to engage people, while I have a product that has to engage
	- Talking to a trainer about how to engage people, since that’s their whole thing
Thinking of how to get better “in-role”
- Don’t appreciate the power of it, that’s the ticket to really developing
- Tricky line to walk, because you need to feel comfortable to product, but need to understand that function is priority
	- Comfort can get in the way of function, but lack of comfort can lead to lack of function (things don’t work, shoots an idea dead)
L&D, internally, holds higher standards than external learners have for L&D
- The best growth of an L&D professional is time spent *outside* the industry, key elements is “does the learner understand the function they need to do.”
Our job, on something like the PFW: 
	in Nov, if launches in Oct, our job is to go to leaders, if an individual says they weren’t trained, and go “no, we did train on that.”
Training Prioritization:
- Big, paradigm-shifting things (PFW):
	- throw all the bells and whistles at it – eLearnings, simulations, the whole nine-yards. 
- Medium/Small: smaller things, like videos, short-quizzes, [[P&P Acknowledgements]]
## FPP’s to pay attention to
- Marty Garner – Scheduling (lot of agreement on the “how to”)
- Precon and Estimating one – standardizing how a PM needs to engage and work with precon and estimating
	- Going to be a hard project, yes, but also aligning different stakeholders to say yes to the content
## SD’s New Role
- Field is a big piece. Org is seeing more about training people like foreman,
