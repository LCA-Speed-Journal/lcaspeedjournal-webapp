## Minor Tasking 
## Reading Log 
### Podcasts during AM Cardio
- Tuura on MTN
	- Jumping right into OVC ISOs on Patellar *likely* will blow up the knee – Achilles, on the other hand, is more load-tolerant even when there’s pathology there
	- Good to train both sides, regardless of injury site. Pathology likely present on uninjured side, even if not symptomatic at the time.
- [[Boo Shexnayder]] on Just-Fly
	- “General Training:” training that isn’t high-velocity, isn’t high-strength, but is more to improve general quality of movement.
		- Connects to [[1x20]]??
	- Tonic and (linear?) Tissues: the Tonic Tissues help position for optimal force output, not nearly as contributory to power but valuable for the vector direction
## Accomplishments 
## Gratitude 
## Health
