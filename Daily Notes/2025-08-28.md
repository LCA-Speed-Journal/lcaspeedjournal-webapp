## Minor Tasking 
## Reading Log 
#### Randy Huntington Webinar with LILA
- We are facilitators to athletes finding their own solutions
- Battle is not in producing force, but in applying it (direction/timing)
- Create a model first, then work on training to it
	- Don’t try to do this concurrently, or create a model after the fact. Make things conform to how you’ve set them out from the beginning.
## Accomplishments 
## Gratitude
