## Minor Tasking 
## Reading Log 
## Podcast: Tendon Talks
[[Hunter Eisenhower]] and [[Jake Tuura]] on Tendons
- Healthy Tendon? Doesn’t need as much long-yielding, needs more short OVC
- Early-Season, long-yielding works well, and can be analgesic in the mid, but for actual stiffness gains, we want to either
	- a) Short OVC ISOs
	- b) Full-ROM STR Work
- Women are predisposed to less tendon stiffness: don’t usually need to worry as much about things like Jumpers-Knee
	- They can reap more benefits of moderate-load and OVC ISOs 
	- Coming from a lower floor, more “low-hanging fruit” here
