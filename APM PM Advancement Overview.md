# Basic Overview
Backstory: FPP initiative, need to break out the progression from APM to PM
Need to take the content and split it out into something that can be impactful and move the needle in the company
A program that will not only give formal learning, but assignment based learning and on the job training to give a well-rounded and structured development plan for the employee.
> In sum: **“What do I have to do to promote? What do I need to do to go from APM-1 to APM-2, etc.”**
## Content: 
13 Skills, each with 36 milestones.
- Task analysis has been performed, confirmed material with SMEs,
- cross-referenced with what we currently have and what we could have with NECA
What we need to develop:
- What’s the framework here at ArchKey
- What are the tool(s) we use for the skill
- (send them off for on-the-job training with some bridges for convo starters, etc.)
## Delivery
Working with ops leaders for this quarter, job will be to help make sure APM-PM learning is happening the way we want it to.
Looking at all the skills, and the complexity of PM specificity, plus project scope, it’s a different leg of the stool to go “we’re always going to need to have some white-glove service to determine IDP for each APM on their progression to PM”
