# Comparative Overview
This analysis compares the two temporary of a **Gravel Track** and **Roll-Out Runway** to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential gaps in consideration.
## Executive Summary
Two temporary solutions for track and field training facilities: a gravel track surface and roll-out runway systems.
- Both solutions address immediate training needs while a proper long-term track facility is planned, though neither fully meets all team requirements.  Both solutions likely maintain dependency on external facility rental for certain event groups.
	- The gravel track provides a full 400m oval for distance athlete pacing and serves the broader school community.
		- carries significant safety concerns that limit its use for high-speed and high-force activities (sprints, jumps, hurdling),
		- requires substantial investment ($293k-$314k total),
		- remains weather-dependent. 
	- The roll-out runway offers a weather-independent, safe training surface that enables year-round indoor use with spikes, maintains clear temporary status to preserve urgency for a proper solution, and represents a substantially lower investment ($3.5k-$5.7k, approximately 1-1.5% of the gravel track cost).
		- Limited to 30m lengths
		- cannot provide distance pacing or max-velocity work, requires daily setup/tear-down.

# **Recommendation:** 
The **roll-out runway** appears more advantageous as a temporary measure, providing better value through its lower cost, superior safety profile for intended use, weather independence that enables year-round preparation, and clear temporary nature that maintains institutional pressure for a proper long-term solution, while avoiding the significant safety and financial risks associated with the gravel track.
