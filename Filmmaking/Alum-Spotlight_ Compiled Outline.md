# **Hook**
*(Timestamp: 17:06-17:15)*
> “I’m grateful for the community around me, for coaches, teammates, people that’ll come alongside me and push me when I didn’t want to be pushed, because I know I wouldn’t have done it by myself.”

# **Who is Sophia?**

> “My name is Sophia Anderson, I graduated Liberty Classical Academy, class of 2025\.  
> I’ll be graduating from Dallas Baptist University, class of 2029\. Right now, I run on the track team…in the heptathlon and the pentathlon…and I study as a pre physician's-assistant right now.”
> 
> “I started basketball originally, and then started track in middle school as a way to stay in shape outside of basketball season…and then just never stopped.”

# **Track Applicability and Program Impact**

> “I think track is one of those sports where **it really just teaches you how to be athletic.** Helps your vertical, helps your speed, helps your power.  
> It made me a lot stronger, especially with the weights out of season, which then turned into powerlifting, which has been a whole ‘nother thing.”
> 
> “**I think we have a really special community in that the upperclassmen really do interact with the underclassmen, a lot.** We get to really come alongside them, both on and off the track, and kind of mentor them.”
> 
> “I think the True-Team 4x4 that we had, where there’s only those four guys running, but the whole team was there, everyone was supporting each other, everyone was cheering them on.”
> 
> “**I love this team. I love our little community.** I always come back to it.”

# **Values**

> “Some of the biggest things that Liberty Track has taught me is not even necessarily track things. Just **how to be a good student-athlete, how to show up, how to be a captain, how to be part of a good team,** things like that.”
> 
> “I think both here and at DBU, we have **really strong communities** where everyone can be there for each other.”
> 
> “We had an experience the first night we went to the meet. It was just the pent crew and the 5k crew. And we stood there while they ran for SIXTEEN LAPS, and we cheered and were on our feet the whole time.”
> 
> “We had people transfer to DBU because they saw us at meets and said, ‘I want what they have—that community and that cheering and that love they have for each other in the sport.”

# **Wisdom and Lessons Learned**

> “I think **I see God’s hand in my determination.** I think that He wired me in a way where I will just get up and keep going, and He gives me the strength to get through it. And He gave me a love for the sport.”
> 
> “Being a multi-athlete, you just kind of start out and you’re learning everything new. And it really just gives you the mindset of ‘right now, it’s not that deep.’ Because if you’re doing one thing, and you don’t think you’re that great at it…you have six more events to go do. You don’t have time to cry over it.”
> 
> “I wish I would have known that **you’re gonna fail a lot more than you think you are**…you just have to embrace the failure sometimes, learn from it.”
> 
> “**Care enough to show up, but beyond that, just go have fun.** Put in the time, be with your teammates and your coaches, and enjoy the experience.”

# **Closing and Call-to-Action**

> “Even if you’re, I don’t know, later in high school, go try new things. Go have fun. If you’re really worried about it, bring a friend.”
> 
> “If you want to join track, **there is an event for you,** and you’ll find something that you enjoy and you’re good at.”
> 
> “I love that even though we’re all training different things, **we’re all still one team.**”
