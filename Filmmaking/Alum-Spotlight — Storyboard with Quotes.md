## The Hook
(see timestamps 17:06-17:15)
*”I’m grateful for the community around me, for coaches, teammates, people that’ll come alongside me and push me when I didn’t want to be pushed, because I know I wouldn’t have done it by myself.”*

*”I love that even though we’re all training different things, we’re all still one team.*

## Who is Sophia?
(see timestamps 00:32-00:50; 01:24-01:38; 01:01-01:09; 19:37-19:47)
*”My name is Sophia Anderson, I graduated Liberty Classical Academy Class of 2025. I'll be graduating from Dallas Baptist University, class of 2029.
Right now, I run on the track team…[cut to] in the heptathalon and the pentathalon…[cut back to] and I study as a pre-physicians assistant right now.”*

*”I started basketball originally, and then started track in middle school [cut to] as a way to stay in shape outside of basketball season…and then just never stopped.”*

*”I think track is one of those sports where it really just teaches you how to be athletic.”*

*”Helps your vertical, helps your speed, helps your power. It made me a lot stronger, especially with the weights out of season, which then turned into powerlifting, which has been a whole ‘nother thing.”*

## Program Impact
(see timestamps 06:34-06:35; 22:23-22:35)
*”I think we have a really special community [cut forward] in that the upperclassmen really do…interact with the underclassmen…a lot. We get to really come alongside them, both on and off the track, and kind of mentor them.”*

(cuts between)*”*I think the True-Team 4x4 that we had,”* *”…where there’s only those four guys running, but the whole team was there, everyone was supporting each other, everyone was cheering them on.”*

*“I love this team. I love our little community. I always come back to it.”*

## Transition and Validation
(see timestamps 11:04-11:36; 10:32-10:51; 24:41-25:18; 26:45-26:57)
*”Some of the biggest things that Liberty track has taught me is not even necessarily…track things…. Just how to be a good student-athlete, how to show up, how to be a captain, how to be part of a good team, things like that.”*

*”I think both here and at DBU, we have really strong communities where everyone can be there for each other.”*

*“We had an experience…the first night we went to the meet, it was just the pent crew and the 5k crew. And we stood there while they ran FOR SIXTEEN LAPS, and we cheered and were on our feet the whole time.”*

*”We had people transfer to DBU because they saw us at meets and said ‘I want what they have—that community and that cheering and that love they have for each other in the sport.’”*

## Wisdom and Call-to-Action
(see timestamps 17:31-17:50; 2:46-3:08; 18:50-19:14; 3:33-3:45; 6:02-6:22)
*”I think I see God’s hand in my determination. I think that He wired me in a way where I will just get up and keep going, and He gives me the strength to get through it. And He gave me a love for the sport.”*

*”Being a multi-athlete…you just kind of start out and you’re learning everything new. And it really just gives you the mindset of ‘right now, it’s not that deep.’ Because if you’re doing one thing, and you don’t think you’re that great at it…[cut to] You have six more events to go do. You don’t have time to cry over it.”*

*”I wish I would have known that you’re gonna fail a lot more than you think you are…you just have to embrace the failure sometimes, learn from it.”*
*”You just got to get up, keep going. At the end of the day, it’s not that deep.”*

*”Care enough to show up, but beyond that just go have fun. Put in the time, be with your teammates and your coaches, and enjoy the experience.”*

## Closing
(see timestamps 23:40-24:03; 6:02-6:22)
*”If you want to join track, there is an event for you, and you’ll find something that you enjoy and you’re good at.”*

(cuts between) *”…even if you’re, I don’t know, later in high school…Go try new things…”* *”Go have fun. If you’re really worried about it, bring a friend.”*
