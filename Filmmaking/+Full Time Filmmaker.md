## Lighting Mastery
### The Basics
#### What is Lighting? What is Cinematography?
Lighting plays a huge role in cinematography, because it can completely manipulate how the final product looks, creatively.
Overarching purpose is to create and convey emotion — lighting enhances that ability to convey
	Should do each lighting component with purpose.
Cinematography can be confused with videography
- Cinematographer starts from scratch when creating a story
- Videographer captures an existing story (wedding, event, etc)
#### Grip Basics
##### Stands
- Spreader Stand — tri-pointed base, with a baby pin (most common uses for basic lights)
	- Junior Receiver — a slot for heavier lights, some come with an adapter that have a pin for smaller lights
- Communication is Key — find someone to help lift things, etc.
	- Start with the top-most riser, then work down — saves time once it’s out of reach
	- When bringing down, use hand as a brake
- Wherever you have stands, bring a sandbag — last thing you want is a light tipping
	- Sandbag should go on the front-leg of the spreader stand
- C-Stand — sandbag goes on the largest leg
	- Terms for the C-Stand Arm — Grip-Arm and Knuckle
	- Place the load over the largest leg of the C-Stand, and over the R side of the stand
- Boom Arm — can mount in a C-Stand, or handheld for smaller lights/mics
	- Place sandbags **before** adding lights, particularly when using a boom
##### Accessories
- Spud Adapter (“Butt Plug”) — combo stand w/Junior adapts to be a baby-pin light
- Apple-Box
	- Cardellini Clamp — can clamp to edge of pancake, then mount a light onto baby pin
		- End-Jaw (good for tucking against narrow places) vs Center-Jaw
- Safety-Cable — acts as a safety-net for lights, should they fall. An extra security measure.
- Nail-On Plate — 
- Lollipop — junior pin, slots into a junior receiver. Baby-Pins can slide into the adapter, etc.
- Duck Bill — Vice Grips with crimp, great for pinching foam board or bounce boards
- Grip-Clip (or A-Clamp) — 
	- Clothes Pin (C-47) — great for adding gels to lights, etc.
- Stinger (an Extension Cord)
- Breakdown 4x4 Frame — 
- Diffusion Material — higher the number of grid, thicker the material
#### Film-Set Terms and Etiquette

### The Technical
#### Types of Lighting — Key, Fill, Rim, Back, etc.
- Key — main light hitting subject
	- 
- Rim-Light — isolate rim or edge of subject to separate from the background
- Back-Light — similar to rim-light, likely placed more directly behind
- Side-light — easy to achieve, but creates a lot of contrast when perpendicular
- Fill-Light — filling in unwanted shadows in the image
	- Don’t always need a light, can just use a bounce-board
- Bottom-Light — less common, since it’s unnatural. Can emulate horror/unnerving
- Rembrandt Lighting — creating a triangle of light on the shadow-side of the subject
	- Follow the 45-and-45 rule — 45 up, 45 out
	- Great for interviews
- Practical Lighting — any light-fixture visible in the frame (a lamp, etc.)
- Ambient Lighting — any lighting that feels directionless, soft, no shadows
	- Made to feel as though the light just exists in the space
#### Direction of Light
- Far-Side Key (Upstage Lighting) — drawing line thru nose, light source is on far side
	- Rolloff across the face, shadow sided and light sided — pleasing contrast
- Near-Side Key — not as pleasing visually
- Side-Lighting — simple and easy to achieve
	- Typically makes sense with relation to things like a window
- Front-Light — considered “ugly” because it washes out shadows, minimizes contrast, is flat
	- Good Use — eliminating wrinkles
- Beauty Lighting — front-ish keylight, but angle down 30deg and place above the subject
	- Used for a lot of modeling, because it minimizes wrinkles
- Top-Lighting — very natural lighting, feels very ambient
	- Above and Back — mean-looking intimidating character, or mysterious
	- Above and Front — looks more natural, as though coming from the ceiling
- Back-Lighting — get an edge-lighting effect, but no exposure to subject
	- Mysterious or silhouetted — pair with bright backdrop, can lead to contrasting
- Bottom-Lighting — not very frequent, a little awkward, casts sharp shadows
	- Campfire stories, more “sinister” appearance
- Always flexibility in where lights can move
#### Diffusing Light
Diffusion Material
- Grid, Frost, ½, ¼, etc.
- ¼ Grid Silent — thin, but not as noisy as usual diffusion material.
- Full Frost — texture similar to a shower-curtain, more subtle, but still takes edge off
- Magic Cloth — bedsheet-like, stronger diffusion than frost
- Unbleached Muslin — very thick, casts a little warmer than other options, 
Light Placement — plays a big role in how light casts on subject
- Smaller the source, harder the light (distance from the diffusion grid/cloth)
- Transmitting vs Bouncing Light — through a diffuser vs off a diffuser
More Diffusion?
- Double Diffusion — passing through two layers of diffusion, but needs brighter light
- Book Light — diffusion setup like a half-open book (light bounces through layer of diffusion)
#### White Balance and Color-Temp
1000K (very warm, red) to 10,000K (very cool, blue)
Natural Daylight — typically 5600K
Gel-Modifiers — adjust the temperature of the light
When Setting Camera — what do you want fixtures to look like (warmer, white, or cooler)
#### RGB Lighting
Colors have Emotions:
- Red — Strong, Passion, Strength, Intimacy
- Pink — Softer
- Blue — Trust, Success, Loyalty
Colors have themes:
- Monochromatic 
- Complimentary
- Analagous
- Triadic
#### High Key vs Low Key
High Key — Bright, Full-Light (lots of keys, even exposure)
- Minimal Contrast, comedies, sitcoms, etc.
Low-Key — Darker, Heavy-Light (deep shadows, sharp highlights)
- Moodier, dark and heavy
#### 3 Point Lighting
- Key — main source lighting the subject
	- General placement — 45deg from camera, 45deg up from subject
		- Leads to a more Rembrandt-style lighting
- Rim-Light — separating the subject from the background
	- lighting the darker shoulder, the hair, and creating a full outline of subject
	- “Cross Key” — 180deg from key-light, on average
- Fill Light — might be better off using a bounce-board
- Note — Creative use of light (in background, etc) is a great way to create visual interest
#### Practicals vs Motivated
Motivated Lighting — artificial light you’re adding, but has a motivating reason
- Want it to look natural and normal
- Viewer’s eye naturally will go to brightest part of image — want this to be our subject
	- Need to mix practicals (lights in-frame) with motivated to help balance brightness
- Goal of motigated lighting is to give the appearance that it’s coming from the practicals
- Strategic addition of practical lighting can make the other lights seem more appealing
#### Exposing Camera for Lighting
- Step 1 — Turn off all the lights, start with a clean-slate
- Step 2 — Expose for what you can’t control (outside light, etc.)
	- Don’t want these sources blown out
#### Using Haze
A great way to add additional atmosphere to a scene
- Creates atmosphere pools of light, and shafts of light from hard-sources
- Creates diffusion as light passes through it
How to Blend Haze
- Any flat item to even out haze (bin-cover, bounce-board)
