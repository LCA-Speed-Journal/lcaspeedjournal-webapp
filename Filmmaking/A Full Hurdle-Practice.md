### A Full Hurdle-Practice
**When:** Week 13, Day 5
**Purpose:** A new sub-group this year, with their own practices. Walk through “a day in the life” with them to show the key drills they do from start to finish 
	(mostly showing how low-volume it is while still being high-intent)
#### Key Clips
- Strength and Mobility — Seated Leg-Lifts (Lead/Trail)
- Daily Drills — Wall Drills
- Accelerations — With Accel-Marks
- Blocks + Hurdles — Facing the Athlete over the Hurdle (other end of Gym)
