**When:** Week 6, Day 4 
	(Thursday, January 12, 2026)
**Purpose:** A key value of our team, reminding those who have the assumption that track is “a lot of running” that we simply don’t operate that way for sprints/jumps/hurdles.
## Key Clips
- As Fresh, Fast, Frequent as Possible — Measuring KPI’s
- Talk through the idea of the speed-reserve — visuals about ceiling vs Maintenance
# Storyboard
## Thesis Statement
*Establish core message & authority*
Framing: Medium shot (waist-up)	
Location: Clean indoor space	
On Camera: Head Coach	
Dialogue:	
	“Nobody likes conditioning. And that's why we don’t do it.”
Props / Equipment:	
	Table or clipboard (optional)
Post: Whip-Zoom to Face — Title text overlay	
## Introducing the Assumption
*Set up misconception*
Framing: Medium-wide	
Location: Same as Shot 2	
Post: Animated Character (Kyle) Appears	
	“Wait—doesn’t track just involve a lot of running?”
On Camera: Head Coach	
Dialogue:	
	“That’s what most people think, but it isn't always true.”

## Distance Sidebar
*Purpose: Clarify scope without derailing*	
Framing: Same as Shot 3 (continuity)	
Location: Same	
On Camera: Head Coach	
Dialogue:	
	“Of course, distance events are different.
	They train to match their event demands.”
	“But for the speed and power side of the sport—400m or shorter—
	we use a lot less ‘running’ than some assume.”

## Quality over Quantity — Sprint Training
*Purpose: Visual proof of philosophy*	
Framing: Side profile	
Location: Turf-Field (Dome) — Sideline (Walking)	
On Camera: Head Coach (walking Kyle down the sideline)	
Dialogue:	
	“For sprints, jumps, and hurdles, we don’t pile on volume.”
	“We keep total work lower, but with much higher intent.”
Post: Kyle (Walking) — Text overlays (“Lower Volume,” “Higher Intent”)	
## Introducing the Speed Ceiling
*Purpose: Speed Reserve "Purpose"*	
Framing: Medium shot	
Location: Turf-Field (Dome) — Sideline (Facing)	
On Camera: Head Coach	
Dialogue:	
	“I’d rather raise the ceiling of top speed with quality, rather than
	slog through to improve how long you can survive at sub-max.”
Post: Kyle (looking up at H. Coach) — Speed-Ceiling Visual	
## Speed Reserve Demonstration and Application
*Purpose: Anchor concept in real data*	
Framing: Medium-wide	
Location: Turf field	
On Camera: Head Coach (foreground), Finish-Gate Visible Behind	
Dialogue:	
	“Let’s take two athletes.”
(Faster)	“One athlete runs a Fly-10 in 1.18 — 19mph.”
(Slower)	“This other runs it in 1.29 — 17.3.”
Props / Equipment: Timing Gates + Display	
## Speed Reserve Whiteboard-Style Graphics
*Purpose: Explain why the difference matters*	
Framing: Medium shot OR full graphic takeover	
Location: Same or neutral background	
On Camera: Head Coach (optional)	
Dialogue:	
	“If they both hold 17mph, that’s almost 98% for the slower athlete—
	but only about 89% for the faster one — almost 10% less effort.”
Props / Equipment: Whiteboard or None	
Post: Animated speed ceilings — Target Speed Line — % Indicators	
## Why This Matters
*Purpose: Reinforce payoff*	
Framing: Whiteboard or Continued Graphics	
Location: Whiteboard or Neutral Background	
On Camera: Animated Athletes	
Dialogue:	
	“Raising the ceiling will improve times even as distance increases—
	because with a higher ceiling, the same speeds aren't as tiring.
	“We choose to focus on bringing that up.”
Post: Animated Characters (Kyle and Brad)	
## Closing and Reframing
*Purpose: Values-driven ending*	
Framing: Medium Shot (athletes visible in background)	
Location: Turf Field (Dome)	
On Camera: Head Coach	
Dialogue:	
	“Plus, shorter, higher-intensity work is more enjoyable—
	—and more enjoyment leads to higher intent.”
	“Rather than grinding through a bunch of reps, we want to be focused and work to raise that ceiling."
	“If we can have more fun in the process, and still improve? Feels like a win to me.”
