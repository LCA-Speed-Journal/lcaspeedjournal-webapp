## Purpose

Drive recruitment for spring season signups by showcasing alumni success and program impact through authentic testimony.

---

## BEAT 1: THE HOOK (0:00-0:15)

**Purpose:** Stop the scroll, establish intrigue

### Content/Audio

**Option A:** Start mid-story — her describing a pivotal moment of challenge or breakthrough

- _"I remember standing at the starting line thinking, 'I have no idea what I'm doing'..."_

**Option B:** A bold statement about identity/growth

- _"Being a multi-event athlete taught me that failure isn't the opposite of success—it's part of it"_

### Visuals

- **Best option:** Open with collegiate meet footage (indoor pentathlon broadcast)—even if angles aren't perfect, the "broadcast feel" adds legitimacy
- **Alternative:** Powerful meet photo from 11th-12th grade (podium shot, mid-competition intensity)
- **Day-of detail shots:** Extreme close-ups of hands, eyes, feet in starting position—creates cinematic tension

### Execution Notes

- Quick cuts (2-3 second holds) to build energy
- If audio hook is about a specific event, match visual to that event
- **Text Overlay:** Her name + "DBU Heptathlete | [Your Program] Alum '20XX"

---

## BEAT 2: WHO IS SHE? (0:15-0:35)

**Purpose:** Build connection, establish credibility

### Content/Audio

**Likely drawn from:** ORIGIN questions

- How she got started in track (youth/early passion)
- Brief mention of her range of athletics
- What track meant to her amid everything else

**Narrative arc:** "I wasn't always a heptathlete..." → positions her as relatable, not a superhero from birth

### Visuals

**B-roll sequence:**

1. **Middle school photo** (1-2 seconds)—establishes "I started young"
2. **9th-10th grade photo** (2-3 seconds)—shows progression
3. **Basketball/powerlifting photos** (3-4 seconds each)—"broad range of athletics"
4. **11th-12th grade meet photo** (hold longer, 4-5 seconds)—arrival at track as primary focus

**Day-of shots to add:**

- Her holding an old medal or looking at a throwback photo (if she brings memorabilia)
- Close-up of a team photo she's in

### Execution Notes

- Ken Burns effect (slow zoom/pan) on still photos to add movement
- This is where stills work best—you're literally showing her timeline
- Music begins to build

---

## BEAT 3: THE PROGRAM'S IMPACT (0:35-1:20)

**Purpose:** Show transformation — THIS IS YOUR RECRUITMENT GOLD

### Content/Audio

**Likely drawn from:** TEAM, DEVELOPMENT, and LEADERSHIP questions

**Key moments to hit:**

- **What the team gave her** (likely: belonging, challenge, growth)
    - _"Being part of this team meant..."_
- **Leadership/culture moment** — a specific story with teammates that illustrates the culture
    - This is where emotion lives; look for her describing a moment that still makes her light up
- **How multi-event training shaped her mindset** — the "meta-skill" of learning hard things
    - _"Learning to throw javelin when I'd never held one before taught me..."_

### Visuals

**B-roll rotation (longest beat—need variety):**

1. **Practice footage in the gym** (10-15 seconds total, broken into 2-3 clips)
    
    - Group drills = perfect for "team" talk
    - Side-profile starts in gymnasium = "learning new things" narrative
2. **Meet photos with teammates** (15-20 seconds total)
    
    - Use 3-4 different photos, Ken Burns effect
    - Photos of her WITH people (not just solo) during team/leadership talk
3. **Track seniors graduating class photo** (5-8 seconds)
    
    - Hold this during "what being part of this team meant"
4. **Her on podium** (5 seconds)
    
    - During any talk of growth/achievement
5. **Hurdles footage on actual track** (8-10 seconds)
    
    - Your best "traditional track visual," save for a key moment

**Day-of shots (CRITICAL for this beat):**

- **Her watching old footage/photos and reacting** (shoot her face while she looks at laptop/phone)
- **Detail shots:** Starting blocks, hurdles, equipment close-ups
- **Her gesturing/talking with hands** (multiple angles of interview itself)

### Execution Notes

- Mix motion (practice footage) with stills (photos)
- When she tells a specific teammate story, hold on a photo of them together
- Motion = energy, stills = nostalgia
- **Text Overlay (strategic):** Key phrases like "Team Captain" or pull quotes emphasizing culture/growth

---

## BEAT 4: THE TRANSITION & VALIDATION (1:20-1:50)

**Purpose:** Show the program prepared her for the next level

### Content/Audio

**Likely drawn from:** DBU CURRENT CHAPTER questions

- What she felt prepared for at DBU (validates your program's effectiveness)
    - _"When I got to DBU, I realized how much [your program] had prepared me for..."_
- What surprised/challenged her (shows growth is ongoing)
- Brief nod to coaches/teammates at DBU (keeps it gracious, not comparative)

**Strategic framing:** This isn't "she left and got better elsewhere"—it's "the foundation we built launched her to thrive at the next level"

### Visuals

**B-roll sequence:**

1. **Signing day photos** (8-10 seconds)—CRUCIAL MOMENT
    
    - If multiple angles/moments from signing day exist, use 2-3
    - This is your transition anchor: "the program launched me here"
2. **Collegiate meet footage** (15-20 seconds)
    
    - Break into 2-3 different events from pentathlon
    - Even mediocre angles work—it's PROOF of next level
3. **DBU teammate photos** (8-10 seconds)
    
    - 2-3 photos she sends, quick cuts

**Day-of shots:**

- **Her in DBU gear** (if she brings any)—detail shot of DBU shirt/sweatshirt
- Close-up of any DBU medals/awards

### Execution Notes

- Signing day emotion = "the program launched me here"
- Collegiate footage validates it worked
- Music continues building

---

## BEAT 5: THE WISDOM/CALL TO ACTION (1:50-2:45)

**Purpose:** Inspire and recruit

### Content/Audio

**Likely drawn from:** PERSPECTIVE questions + advice questions

**Content flow:**

1. **Gratitude** — what she's most grateful for in her journey
    
    - Keeps it emotional and reflective
2. **Faith integration** — how she sees God's hand in her story
    
    - Hits your program's values, appeals to families/faith-minded recruits
3. **The "wish I'd known earlier" wisdom** — about growth, patience, process
    
    - This is for current/prospective athletes watching
4. **Direct encouragement** — to young women on the fence
    
    - _"If you're thinking about joining track, here's what I'd say..."_
    - Or: _"To young women who want to pursue excellence in sport and faith..."_

### Visuals

**AUDIO-DRIVEN beat. Visuals support, don't compete. Slower pacing, longer holds.**

**B-roll approach:**

1. **Contemplative meet photos** (her looking up, catching breath, thoughtful moments)—10-15 seconds
    
2. **Practice footage, slowed down** (50-70% speed if usable clips exist)—10 seconds
    
3. **Podium/achievement photos** (during gratitude talk)—8-10 seconds
    
4. **Team photos** (during faith/community talk)—8-10 seconds
    
5. **Collegiate footage or signing day** (during "wish I'd known" wisdom)—8-10 seconds
    
6. **Rotate through basketball/powerlifting/track** (during "young women pursuing excellence")—15 seconds total
    

**Day-of shots (ESSENTIAL for this beat):**

- **Interview shots of her face**—genuine, unguarded moments
    - Get her smiling, emotional, thoughtful
    - These carry authenticity that B-roll can't
- **Her hands while talking** (if she's expressive)
- **Over-the-shoulder shot** of her during interview
- **Wide shot** establishing the interview space

### Execution Notes

- Let her face be on screen MORE here
- B-roll supports but doesn't dominate
- Music softens/pulls back during most emotional moments
- Her wisdom is the star
- **Text Overlay:** Pull her most quotable line here

---

## BEAT 6: THE CLOSE (2:45-3:00)

**Purpose:** Clear CTA, program branding

### Content/Audio

Her final thought — likely from the "on the fence" or "encouragement" question

### Visuals

- **Final powerful shot:** Podium shot, team celebration, or her mid-competition with intensity
- **Alternative:** If you get a great shot of her smiling directly at camera during interview, use that
- **Fade to program logo/branding**

**Text Overlay:**

- "Spring signups open [DATE]"
- "[Your Program] Track & Field"
- "Come write your story" (or similar tagline)

### Execution Notes

- Music builds to triumphant close
- Let final visual breathe for a moment before CTA overlays appear

---

## DAY-OF SHOT LIST (Priority Order)

### CRITICAL (Must-Have)

1. **Multiple angles of the interview itself**
    
    - Her face (primary)
    - Her gestures/hands
    - Over-shoulder shot
    - Wide establishing shot
2. **Detail shots**
    
    - Hands, feet in starting position
    - Equipment close-ups (starting blocks, hurdles if available)
    - Medals, awards
    - Old photos/memorabilia

### HIGH PRIORITY

3. **Her reacting to old footage/photos**
    
    - Shoot her face while she looks at laptop/phone with old content
    - Capture genuine reactions
4. **Any DBU gear/memorabilia close-ups**
    
    - Shirts, sweatshirts, medals, etc.

### IF TIME ALLOWS
