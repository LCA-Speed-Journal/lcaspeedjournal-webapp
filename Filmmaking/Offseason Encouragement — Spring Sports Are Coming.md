### Offseason Encouragement — Spring Sports Are Coming
**When:** Week 2, Day 1
**Purpose:** Give a shoutout to our offseason athletes who are continuing to train, while also bringing the focus back around to the fact that we’re gearing up for spring season to start.
#### Key Clips
- **Indoor Meets** — Ben/Jonah running in the USATF Meets
	- A shot or two coming around the track, on the starting line, whatever
- **Weight-Room Work** — Eda/Will lifting in the local gym
	- Getting a few reps in for upper/lower, re-racking weights, etc.
	- Just showing them being active and working for weight-training
- **Equipment Unboxing, Setup** — Matching the athletes’ preparation on our end, letting others know we’re getting ready too. 
	- Software development for the leaderboard app
	- Basic “dusting off the weights” and other prep-work
	- Voltra I Highlight — a new toy, get people going “what’s **that** thing??”
	- (Could throw in a clip of us testing the timing-gates at the dome…that might be funny)
