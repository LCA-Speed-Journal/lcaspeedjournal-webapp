## Cinematography 101
### Rules of Composition
Comp = Placement or arrangement of elements — the “ingredients” of a shot
- 1) Fill the Frame — Don’t Leave too much Dead-Space
	- Can have a wide-shot that shows all the details, but should be intentional
	- Getting closer (or zooming) is almost always going to be the best answer
	- Sidebar — Is the background distracting from the subject?
- 2) Rule of Thirds — Dividing into vertical/horizontal thirds
	- horizon usually goes on one of the horizontals for landscape
	- people usually go on one of the verticals for portrait — lead/looking-room
	- Don’t want too much head-room, but don’t want cutting things off
		- Can break this rule, but should have reason (something happening, etc)
	- Tighter shots are okay, but likely cutting off top rather than bottom
		- Eyes then become the horizontal third
- 3) Symmetry — Framing in the middle works well if the subject is squared up
	- Can also work for things like reflections, then horizon can sit at midline
- 4) Create Depth — Drop-Shadow, Lower-Aperture , and Foreground are common ways
	- Look for opportunities to add layers to the foreground, as well as a background
- 5) Leading Lines — draw the eye to the subject via the shot (bridges, fences, natural lines)
- 6) Balance Diagonally — Balance the weight of the subject with another object in opp. corner
	- Ex. Mic-Stand extends into upper left, so placed laptop as prop in lower right
	- Ex. Subjects walking down stairs in lower-left, statue framed in upper-right
- 7) Patterns and Repetition — human eye loves these, keep an eye out
- 8) Framing — keep an eye out for crooked lines, skewed horizon, etc. 
	- Keep framing vertical/horizontal unless a specific creative direction (i.e. Dutch-Angle)
- 9) Dominant Subject — need to have a clear subject to the image
- 10) Focus — image needs to be in focus, the place where the viewer is looking
### Angles to Enhance Filmmaking
- Why are angles important? 
	- Perspective — multiple perspectives of what they’re looking at
	- Emotion — angles 
	- Editing — becomes a lot easier when you have multiple angles
- Can Multiple Angles be a bad thing?
	- Camera angles should always enhance the story — if not, leave them out
	- Don’t hit detail on watch unless it’s relevant, shoes unless  it connects, etc.
- 1) Wide — usually a wider lens, capture when establishing location so viewer can see
	- Can also portray loneliness or insignificance
- 2) Long — also an establishing shot, but with more focus on the subject
	- Usually best with 
- 3) Medium — waist up, focus on what subject is doing/saying, feeling close to subject
	- Most likely represents distance we naturally see people as
- 4) Cowboy — mid-thigh up, need to show detail around waist
- 5) Tight/Close-Up — Head and Shoulders, showing dialogue or expression
	- Important, intense, or intimate pieces of dialogue or action
	- Tighter lengths, 50-100m
- 6) Detail/Extreme-Close — emphasis or importance on a specific part of the image
	- great way to create mystery and depth in the story
- 7) Low-Angle — make subject appear larger, show power/dominance
	- Can also portray wonder/majesty if surroundings are still larger than subject
- 8) High-Angle — inverse of low, make subject appear weak and inferior
- 9) Dutch-Angle — anytime there’s a slight tilt to horizon
	- Convey uneasy emotion or something being wrong
- 10) Over-the-Shoulder — if two subjects talking, point over one’s shoulder at the other
	- 
- 11) POV — shows what character looking at, take in perspective of character’s state of mind
	- Thrill of being in the driver’s seat
- 12) Cutaway — interruption of continuous scene with view of something else
	- Great to transition to new scenes, or to show side-stories happening at same time
-  180º Rule — don’t change camera angle more than 180º from one shot to the next
	- ex. If shooting two subjects, don’t place both on the same side of frame, place on opposite
- 30º Rule — when cutting between angles of **same** subject, don’t go more than 30º
	- Will feel more connected
- How many to cover?
	- 5 Shot Rule — Cover 5 angles of important action
### Focal Lengths

### Cinematic Lighting
4 Characteristics of Light — Direction, Color, Quantity, Quality
#### Direction and Color
**Direction** — Shadows can form different shapes and patterns
- 3 Point Lighting System — Key-Light, Back-Light, Fill-Light
	- Key — Main Light to hit the subject, placement depends on look (commonly just above subject and 45º from camera. Don’t want to be too high though.)
- Lighting Patterns (typically using a 3-point system)
	- Key-Light
		- Flat Lighting — Directly in front of subject, even and flat.
			- Light-hearted settings or beauty shot, where you just want crisp/clean.
			- Not very cinematic, since there isn’t a lot of Depth
		- Paramount Lighting — as flat, but slightly raised up
			- Get “butterfly effect” under nose, can be a more feminine look (accent cheeks)
			- Can’t get too high, otherwise you’ll start getting racoon eyes.
		- Loop Lighting — slightly to the side of the Butterfly-Lighting
			- Nose-Shadow creates loop on the cheek, used on rounder faces to give slimness
		- Rembrandt Lighting — keep moving to side, connect nose-shadow to cheek
			- Triangle of light on the cheek — creates dramatic look
		- Split-Lighting — light directly to side of subject
			- Super dramatic scenes, more masculine look
	- Back-Light (can also be Rim-Light or Hair-Light)
		- Can create a halo-effect, mimic the “golden-hour” look
		- Use a lamp, a window, anything that might be natural
		- Separates subject from the background around their edges
	- Fill-Light
		- Fills in the subject on the darker side, softens the drama
		- The more fill you use, the less contrast you have
		- High Key Light — high fill, minimal contrast (comedies and commercials)
		- Low Key Light — low fill, high contrast (dramatic, action)
	- Moving Camera can also change how the lighting looks
		- Dark Sided Shooting — preferred for most shooting, particularly over-the-shoulder shots
		- Broad Sided Shooting — camera on the brighter side
	- Subject Positioning — Don’t place Flat Against the Wall
		- Need to create some depth, beyond just the lighting
		- Also helps contrast exposures, with subject being brighter than back
		- Checkerboard Lighting — fill light on dark side of subject
			- Checkerboard because dark subject + lit back, light subject + dark back
		- Gel Lighting — can also create separation by adding some color
**Color** — important to know what temp lights are set to, for a white-balance, but color contrast is a great addition to help give some more dynamic to the shot
- Even just a temperature difference (warm light on subject, cool on background) can create separation
- Gels can help create more color combinations
- Watch out for light-reflections adding unwanted cast to image
	- ex. grassy field giving green tint to subjects in shade
	- Correct if possible, otherwise can adjust in post
#### Quality and Quantity
Quantity: how much light is there, how bright is the light
- Tips for Low-Quantity of Lights
	- Prime Lenses
	- Lower Shutter
	- Raise ISO
	- Neat VID in Post
- High quantity isn’t always great either
	- Ex. noon lighting is very hard, casts deep shadows
Quality: 
- Soft-Light — shadows transition gradually
	- Larger Light-Source, more diffusion, closer to subject
	- Better for faces
- Hard Light — shadows transition abruptly
	- Smaller Light-Source, less diffusion, further from subject
	- Better for back-light and fill-light, since it carves out shadows easier
	- Also better for high-contrast
### Movements
#### Tripod Movements
Least amount of movement of the filming techniques, but still has a place.
- 1) Static — movement is only coming from subject
	- Help focus on subject without distraction — interviews, timelapses, tutorials
	- Enhance the story — so long as goal is to draw attention to subject
- 2) Pan — Moving camera R/L, common in action sports where you can’t physically get closer
- 3) Tilt — Moving up/down
- 4) Zoom — Zooming During a shot, easier with tripods because there’s more stability
	- Can fake in post with digital zoom (keyframing)
	- Snap-Zoom — faster version of the zoom, used in comedy and action (particularly +slow-mo)
- 5) Rack Focus — changing focus of the shot from one subject to another within the shot
	- Can also use when subject is moving toward/away from camera
#### Handheld Shooting — Tips and Movements
- Great for adding intensity
- Moving with the motion of the subject helps accentuate this
- Can control exact movements, rather than at mercy of tripod/gimbal
- Tips for Shooting Handheld
	- 1) Wide-Angle Lens — hides a lot of jitter
	- 2) Hand Placement — R hand on grip, L hand underneath (and on focus ring)
		- Can also use camera strap (held out, so pulls tight) to help stabilize
		- Handles can help as well
	- 3) Move Body, not Hands — easier to control precision, less likely to have jitter
	- 4) Motivated Shots — biggest advantage is being able to move rapidly/precisely
		- Not as limited to things like pans/tilts
	- 5) Keep the Camera Moving
#### Glidecam Movements

#### Gimbal Movements

#### Slider Movements

### Keeping the Subject in Focus, While Moving

### Storytelling 101
Biggest Goal: **Create Emotion.**
	Getting audience to buy into the concept is the “why” behind the emotion
Crucial to learn how to Shoot to Edit — have an idea of the final product when you’re shooting
	Motivates each shot by the end result — where might you need (wide, tight, detail) shots
Shooting the footage is only half of the process, the other half is in the editing Room
6 Editing Tips
- 1) Shot Selection — a lot of the time you’ll end up using less than 10-15% of what you’ve filmed
	- What’s got better composition
	- Don’t need to put more cuts just to fill time, add motion, etc. Trim to fit the needs
- 2) Music Choice — audio is half the viewing experience, creates half the emotion
- 3) Pacing — match the pace to the feel of the film (fast cuts and motion for action, etc.)
- 4) Color — 
	- Warmer is usually happier, Cooler is more dramatic, 
	- Desaturated can be dead/lifeless, Vibrant is full of life and lighthearted
	- Orange/Teal are a more “epic" sense
- 5) Get Feedback — easy to get attached to project, have people as sounding board
- 6) Use 5 Stages of Storytelling
	- 1) Intro / Setup — introduces time/place of the story, provide key detail, give connection to subject
	- 2) Rising Action / Conflict — new action, builds interest, want viewer to see what happens next
	- 3) Climax — want to evoke the most emotion, the main point
	- 4) Falling Action — what’s going to keep viewer to stick around, keep energy going
	- 5) Resolution / Outro — audience feels resolved, show end-results, send off with emotion
### Timelapses and Hyperlapses

### Pre-Production Process
- 1) Idea Conception
	- Find inspiration from other creators, similar videos, etc.
- 2) Create a Rough Shot-List
	- What, from the inspiration, feels cool, shots you want to emulate, etc.
- 3) What are your Available Resources?
	- Locations, Models, Props, Lighting, etc.
	- No point in storyboarding then realizing you don’t have access to a spot, etc.
	- Get permission before shooting, esp. if company owned
- 4) Music Choice — videos can be easier to shoot if you have an idea for music-genre
- 5) Final Shot-List — envision what “the perfect video” might look like
	- Replay the edited song, write down shots as seeing them in head
	- As long as you have key-shots established, can find filler on the day easier
### Using a Green-Screen

### BONUS — Mistakes Beginners Make

### BONUS — Using a 5-in-1 Reflector
- White — more natural, softer reflection
- Silver — harder, but cool tones
	- Don’t place right underneath, typically, because can create weight reflections
- Gold — harder, more warm tones
- Black — adds negative fill, or a dark reflection 
	- Adds depth or contrast
### BONUS — Shooting an Interview (Documentary-Style)
(Related — [[Mark Bone — Interview and Documentary Videos]])
- Interview A
	- Natural light behind subject as partial fill, 
	- key light diffused, hair light diffused
	- Added back-light to give more brightness to background
-  Interview B
	- 
- Steps to Interviewing
	- 1) Location — Where to Film?
		- Location should reflect the story you’re trying to tell
		- Take a bit of extra time to figure out things like leading lines, explore different options, and consider you’re likely going to use two angles (medium and a tighter-angle)
	- 2) Composition — what framing are you using, focal lengths, camera angles
		- Do what Looks Good
		- Recall the 30º Rule, don’t want cuts of same-subject to be more than 30º
		- Not only what is in the frame, but also what’s *not* in the frame — remove unnecessary
	- 3) Lens Choice — 
		- Typical Wide — 35-50mm
		- Depends on how much background you want to see — tighter hides background
		- Most Flattering to Face — 70-100mm
	- 4) Lighting — getting creative, making the room come to life
		- Need a Key, always the first step when lighting the space
			- Bigger Key is softer, more flattering to the face
		- Loop and Rembrandt are most common for interview-style
		- Remember, want to be shooting on the dark-side of the subject
		- Rim or Hair-Light — separate subject from the background
			- Beware hair-light too far off to the side, can catch side/tip of nose
	- 5) Audio — 
		- Good Distance for Boom — 6-14”
		- Straight-Into a Computer (vs an Audio-Recorder)
			- Monitoring audio visually on screen can be nicer
			- Can quickly listen back if needed
		- Recording Level — between -18db and -6db (Peak)
			- don’t want the subject to end up clipping if they laugh, etc.
		- Beware Reverb on set, it’s easier to fix there rather than in post
	- 6) Acoustic Treatment — 
	- 7) Camera Settings — 
		- Shallow Depth-of-Field works well for interviews
		- Shutter at 180 degree rule — double the frame-rate (1/50-60 or so)
	- 8) Interview Process
		- Prep the Talent — what’s going on, what’s the emotion to be portrayed
			- Remind them to be a bit more emotive (speech and body-language)
			- Bullet point of the questions so they can Be Prepared
		- Film with the Edit in Mind — coach on the phrasing, lead-in lines, etc.
			- Condensing things (“can you summarize what you just said in, say, 10 seconds”)
		- Bring different pieces of clothing — pair with the set, for contrast or for continuity
		- Make sure set is figured before talent arrives — maximize and value their time
		- Skin Exposure (in Cam) — around 60-70 IRE, everything else between 5-80 IRE
			- Contrast of Exposure — subject should be a little brighter than everything else
		- Tight Shots — Focus on the eye *closest to camera.*
		- Listen and Respond — leads to more Natural Conversation
		- Can lead in for better editing (“can you start that with (insert phrase)”)
