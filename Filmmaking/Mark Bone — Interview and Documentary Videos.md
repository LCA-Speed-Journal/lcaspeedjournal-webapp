# Interview Styles and Fundamentals
Genre of the film will dictate the style of interview, with some creative flexibility.
Example Styles:
- In-the-Moment — Passive
	- Not interacting with the camera, getting them to say things aloud, on camera, but not directly to camera
	- Ex. Over-the-shoulder of two people talking
- In-the-Moment — Active
	- People in a scene, but talking to the camera
	- Draws audience in, feels a part of the film (Bear Grylls, etc)
- Talking Head — “Netflix-Style,” looking just off camera
	- Person recalling stories, memories, in a calm environment
	- Need to go in with some prep — keep the person from rambling
- Locked-Off Talking Head — subject speaking directly to camera
- Voiceover — just hearing the character’s voice
# Leveling Up Film — Sound Design
- Want Sound Design to Enhance, not Take-Away — not Distracting
- Sync Sound — sound that feels like it originates from the film itself
- Emotive Sound — that which doesn’t originate from the film’s world
# The Art of the Interview — Getting Better Sound-Bites
- Every Question Breaks into 2 Buckets — Info and Emotion
	- Info — Context of the Story (beginning, middle, end)
	- Emotion — People’s Thoughts, Feelings, Insights
	- Final Bucket — Revelation (what the person has learened)
		- how have you changed, what did you learn, how are you a different person, how did it impact your life, how did  you build new perspectives
		- Good films show the growth of people, how someone has/hasn’t changed
- Know Your Story — be Assertive
	- Build questions around that story
- Questions to Get Context
	- Who — Who was there?
	- What — what happened?
	- When/Where — when/where did it happen?
- How to Get Precise Responses
	- When giving context, random details might crop up (ramblings)
		- This is fine, but circle back and get them to summarize in 2-3 sentences
	- Change between context and emotion — will give balance to film, and subjects
# Foundations of Doc Editing — Editing Like a Pro
### Why do Scenes Matter?
Entire silm is just a collection of strung-together scenes in a given order
- Beginning, to the Middle, to the End
It’s important for doc-editors to build out scenes — easy reflex is to build montages
- Resist temptation to take easy route, instead creating fully formed scenes w beginning, mid, end
- Montages are intense, crafting is fun, but they run the risk of burning out audience’s attention span
- Advice: build as many scenes as you can, only relying on montages at very specific moments
### Scene-Building
- Macro POV — bird’s eye view, how do they form a story-arc
	- 90% of scenes are trying to A) Progress the Story, or B) Offer Audience Key-Info
		- Consider intention when visualizing scenes together
		- A way to progress, or an info scene? Differentiate accordingly
		- Contrast creates focus — avoid monotony by disrupting pattern of intention. Variety is always interesting.
- Micro POV — nuts and bolts, what shots and info from footage to translate story effectively
	- Basic Formula — each scene should have own beginning, mid, end.
	- Establishing shots, various close-ups and medium shots, and a final exit shot.
	- 4 Elements
		- Intro — Establishing/Wide-Shot
			- Efficiently relays info on setting and characters
			- Needs to hint at the purpose the scene will cover
		- Setup — Building on the Establishing, progressing towards something
		- Punch-Line (or the Button) — The Intention for the scene
			- open and setup need to work in tandem to give audience info they need to understand the button or the punch- line
		- The Out — Reaffirming intention/punch, easing out and into next scene
	- Don’t linger — keep film moving, don’t extend longer than needs to be.
- Magic Word — Intention
	- important to understand what the intention of each scene is supposed to be
	- Scenario (physical arc) and Message (emotional arc)
# Breakdown: High-End Netflix-Style Interviews
- Tip: Shoot some 60FPS clips of your subject at the end of the interview
	- Detail shots of hands, clothes, silhouette, walking into set, etc
	- Can use to cut in between clips, introduce, etc.
		- 60FPS because you can slow it down and smooth it out
# CBUM — Filming the Documentary
- How to balance Capturing Authentic Moments with capturing inematic Shots?
	- Starting with Easy-Scenes — things the subject is most comfortable with
	- Become Invisible — interact less, become part of daily life
	- Assert Final Vision — assess footage near end, decide what moments you’re missing and direct those
- Looking for Music — find the right song, then go find another one
- Writing the Script, if there is a Script — whatever you right, cut it in half (or more)
	- Just the most punch, the less words the more the impact you’ll get
# How to Interview Better — Doc, Podcasts, Corporate
 -  Tip 1 — Stop Reading your Questions
	 - Put notes aside, pay attention to the subject
	 - Should study, have them in your head, but listen and engage w subject
	 - Make them feel like they’re worth your time, that what they’re saying matters
- Tip 2 — Do a pre-interview
	- Get to know subject before camera is on — basic points, what they know about the story, etc.
	- Don’t go too deep, just making sure the subject is comfortable
- Tip 3 — Get subject Out of Their Head
	- Try to get them as comfortable as possible
	- Camera can be very “judgemental” — stares you down, makes subject intimidated
	- Interviewer’s job is to help cut that intimidation, that it’s just a conversation
- Tip 4 — Get them to repeat your question
	- Repeat the question within the response for complete thoughts
	- If you’re cutting dialogue out from interviewer, need the context of the prompt
- Tip 5 — Don’t Ask people to Repeat Things
	- People get flustered when they don’t speak from the heart
	- People talk better when they aren’t trying to say specific lines
- Tip 6 — Don’t just ask about Information, Ask about Emotion
	- Get them thinking about what happened in their heart, not just in their mind
# Mastering the Art of Interviewing — Step by Step
- Get Someone Taking Notes
	- en.editingtools.io — live-notes with timestamps, helps cut to the important things
- Know the Power of What — 
	- What were you Feeling? What was Going Through Your Head?
	- What are your Goals? What Do you Think will Happen if You Don’t Reach Them?
- Know the difference between emotion and information questions?
	- Often, forget about the emotions.
	- what was that like, how would you describe that time for you
	- what were youfeeling/thinking?
	- Why are you passionate about what you do? When do you feel fulfilled?
- Practice Flow for the Interview — have questions as reference, but flow things together
	- A lot of times, we forget to listen. It’s a conversation, the questions are just a guide.
- Leave 10mins before the interview to just “hang out” with the subject
- Research your character ahead of time — know who you’re interviewing
- Immerse yourself in the impact of the piece — set the stage mentally, as an interviewer
- Never Tell Someone to “Be Comfortable” — job is to create environment, not cue behavior
- Circle Back to First Questions at the End — can get more genuine responses if they weren’t as comfortable at the start
- Never Interrupt — always let people finish their thought
- Have someone else monitoring the questions you wrote — interviewer can stay present
