___
Would like L&D to be in charge of **PowerPoint Slides**
	Go through, be the clicker-person, etc.
#### **Eric Q:** wouldn’t be more effective for instructor to be in charge of slides?
- Instructor is going to be in PFW, super-users following along. 
	We’ll be on the second laptop, the thing solely connected to slides.
- Room Management Document — might have test-manager associated, might have instructor, etc. 
	Easier to have us in charge of the slides, etc.
## Key L&D Responsibilities
- Document process questions (along w Test Manager) — where super-users have questions, are struggling, etc.
	- Can be as simple as piece of paper, reference where answer lived, who asked the question, details, etc.
	- Thought: create a teams-channel or a document that can be shared among all those assisting the process
	- **Key Term: Irritants.** things in the app that might not be as intuitive at this stage in development, etc.
- Need to create a common (where it is housed?) document for all regions to use
- Assist facilitator when they can’t answer a question, use the Team-Channel to ask SMEs in other regions to post an answer
# Logging Issues
- Issue Type: Operational vs Functional
	- Operational: Document Knowledge Base
	- Functional: PFW SME records as a “bug” in ADO
