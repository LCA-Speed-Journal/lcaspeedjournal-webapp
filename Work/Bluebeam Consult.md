___
**Scott**: acct rep, working with Paul C and Lee C (Bluebeam for 6yrs, CO)
- Updated Licensure: making sure everyone has what they need
**Jared**: helps support more accounts, Customer-Success Manager (Bluebeam for 4(?)), UT)
- Deals with access, resources for our users
- Could setup things like Lunch-and-Learns for Bluebeam, he’d host for our user-base if there was a want/need
# Current State
Moving from Revu 20 → 21
- Going to a user-based login, rather than device

# Resources
## **Welcome Packet** 
PDF, points out a lot of the existing Bluebeam resources to redirect learners to
Names Jared as our Customer Success Manager, gives contact for learners to book time directly
## **Bluebeam University**
university.bluebeam.com (their LMS, need Bluebeam login, **and need Revu 21**)
- On-Demand Library, can link to the course but unsure if we can go straight in or if it redirects to the homepage
- Don’t get data direct, but can get from Jared as an export (just need to request)
	- Shows course completions, programs/modules
	- Can export certificates for users
#### Modules of Note
- **[[Revu Essentials]]:** “Intro to Bluebeam,” touches many of the pieces of the tool
- **Start Using Bluebeam:** “Quickstart Guide,” getting up to speed fast
## **Bluebeam Community**
community.bluebeam.com (think Reddit, need Bluebeam Login)
- Brought external forums into a native environment
	- Announced Live-Sessions → Large Webinars hosted Monthly
	- Posts from developers/power-users/regular-users
- Can make suggestions, look at questions direct from users

# Closing Notes
Unsure where users are at in the migration process
There’s a conference happening (Unbound.bluebeam.com) that may be a good resource for our “Bluebeam-Reps” 
	Sept. 30 - Oct. 2 in DC
