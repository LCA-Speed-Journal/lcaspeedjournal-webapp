We’re going to be helping NECA / Electri, because our program is better than theirs from an apprentice-side

# First Reactions
West was overall positive / productive — 
East was entrenched in PFW, viewed more as a change to the tool
N. Central
Central was wanting to find bugs, helped ot have already been in the tool — different sized projects reflected, was a good group to look at for span/scope.

Seems to overall be good engagement, the active role with leaders in the room in the next month is going to be the change-management piece.
# eLearning and Sims
SD Note: We’l walk through the program/journey, but also want to make sure it’s available for individual sims for people to access
	Reference-info, one-offs. Would we want to do a video with annotations?
Do we have what we need?
# Instructor-Led Training
