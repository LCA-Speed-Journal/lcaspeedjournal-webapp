Commuicating information at the right level 

Large projects are relative depending on the office. Need to define per-project strategy.
	Need to account for those who have no background (i.e. defining terms like “fragnet”)
Need to have things boiled down, simplified to the level where it’s digestible.

Using P6 on Small Jobs? Jot really.
	Main thing is baseline schedule, reverse schedule (high-level, critical items), then build 2-4wk lookaheads. Lookahead is the most effective tool, they’ve found, on the smaller-jobs.

Hearing a lot about Microsoft Projects, then incorporating into more specific items from there.

P6 is really just a tool — a lot of projects required by contract. Can do CPM scheduling by hand, even tho it takes a while.
	Excel, Projects (not the best)

Smaller jobs sometimes don’t even get a formal process. Quick math, pull-plan reverse schedule by hand, then break out to hit contract milestones. 

Maybe a questionnaire at beginning of project to help filter into rough buckets of scale (does require P6, filters into requisite section) 
	Even just a few pieces that have prereqs for when they should be included.

Need to figure out yes, how to filter, but also need to define which steps are required regardless of job.
