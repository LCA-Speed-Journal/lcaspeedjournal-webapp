# Overview
From initially 41 meetings, SD tried to narrow down to **“what does L&D need to do here, vs what’s not actually a training need.”** 
## Immediate Asks: This Week
- [x] Read through **key tasks** 📅 2025-09-03 ✅ 2025-10-03
- [x] Read through **summary** of each project 📅 2025-09-03 ✅ 2025-10-03
- [x] Read through **notes** on each project 📅 2025-09-04 ✅ 2025-10-03
- [x] Read through the **action plans** of each project (looking for training-related items) 📅 2025-09-03 ✅ 2025-09-10
- [x] **Validate the right times** listed (key dates) 📅 2025-09-04 ✅ 2025-12-08
- [x] Create **summary of each project** and to-dos 📅 2025-09-05 ✅ 2025-10-03
## Tasks for Next Week
- [x] Reaching out to **Key-Contacts** for each project 📅 2025-09-09 ✅ 2025-09-10
	- Don’t need to re-establish all the base, more just **a handoff from Heather/SD** (they’ve done a lot of the introductions and initial gathering)
# What are the Important Pieces
**Dates** are the most important. 
Workload for us *is* significant, but in actuality, a lot of the initiatives break down to **smaller components**
	(e.g. integrating with T3, etc.)

	- Scott thinks they’re a good idea
	- Duration of Session — Greg more focusing on larger projects currently, but may be a little premature

	- Other Documents — not sure as of now 
	- Office Hours — likely aiming for Feb 10, aiming for 1pm-ish (EST)
