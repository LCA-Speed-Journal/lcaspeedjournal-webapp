Look-Ahead Schedule Development Playbook (Using Spreadsheet) 

 

 

**Step 1: Determine Tool to be Used for Look-Ahead Planning** 

* Suggested options include Master Work Package List (for projects using work packaging) or Labor Tracking Sheet   
* When possible, utilize tool already being developed on project to reduce number of spreadsheets.   
* Spreadsheet may be developed over time.  For example, a Master Work Package list gets developed over the life of the project as Work Packages are defined.  The key is to have Work Packages developed in advance of the Look-ahead duration timeframe.  If the Look-Ahead duration is 6 weeks, the Work Package List should have enough Work Packages developed to cover at least 6 weeks, but should work towards 12 weeks or more. 

 

**Step 2: Gather All Required Information** 

* Review/collect weekly:   
* S-Curve (Planned, Earned, Spent) curve   
* Contract schedule milestones   
* Contract schedule look-ahead report   
* Should be exported to Excel if possible   
* Labor Tracking sheet, Master Work Package List, or similar   
* Whatever tool is used for breaking down project and tracking labor progress   
* Template to summarize look-ahead activities   
* Constraint Log 

**Step 3: Review Contract Schedule** 

* Review upcoming activities from the schedule   
* Scheduler to run report   
* Each row in planning tool should be associated with a schedule activity   
* Start/Finish dates for each activity in the schedule can be transferred to planning tool to assist with prioritization.   
* Review all upcoming milestones to ensure alignment with planned work   
* Enter information in Look-Ahead planning tool to prepare for planning meeting. 

**Step 4: Look-ahead Meeting** 

* PM Team member and Field Leader meet   
* Review upcoming work based on Contract Schedule   
* Consult with Field Leader for upcoming work based on field progress and site conditions.   
* Identify activities for upcoming look-ahead window   
* Tasks not completed during previous window need to be evaluated to determine if they should remain on plan.   
* There may be constraints preventing work from being completed and tasks may drop off look-ahead plan.   
* Use estimated hours and crew size to help determine appropriate amount of work for each crew.   
* Determine dependencies and sequencing   
* Assign crews (foreman) to each task   
* Identify constraints  

**Step 5: Update Look-ahead Plan** 

* PM Team to use information from Look-ahead meeting   
* Update Look-ahead planning tool based on discussions during meeting with field leader.   
* Update Look-ahead Plan to include all work to be performed during look-ahead window.   
* Update Constraint Log to include anything identified that could prevent the completion of an upcoming task.   
* Work with Scheduler to determine if Project Schedule needs to be updated.   
* Look-ahead plan could change sequencing and may need to be incorporated into project schedule. 

**Step 6: Distribute Plan** 

* Distribute to PM team, Field Leaders, GC, Subs, other trades, vendors as appropriate   
* Use to communicate plan in weekly GC look-ahead meetings   
* Share Constraint log and communicate priority issues to GC.  This should be done in person or over the phone and follow up by emailing Constraint log. 

 

**Step 7: Update Progress** 

* Update progress weekly to determine actual work completed   
* Update any related reporting (for example % of work packages completed as planned)   
* Repeat process starting at Step 2
