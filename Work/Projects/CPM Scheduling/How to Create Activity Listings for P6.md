# How to Create Activity Listings for P6

Creating activity listings for P6 involves building a comprehensive list of project activities using fragnets, standard activities, and project-specific tasks that will be imported into Primavera P6 for schedule development.

## Review Available Resources

1. Review ArchKey's repository of fragnets and example schedules for applicability to your project
2. Use available fragnets if they match your project scope and sequencing
3. Use Level 1 schedule activities as a basis for building L3 activities if applicable: L3 activities can roll up to the L1 activities
4. Save a copy of the Schedule Loader sheet template for your project

## Set Up Loader Sheet Structure

1. Add GC milestones to the loader sheet as anchor points
2. Copy fragnets, sample activities, or L1 activities into the loader sheet as a starting point
3. Organize activities under the appropriate WBS sections
4. Verify the loader sheet structure aligns with the WBS structure provided to the Scheduler

## Add Standard Activities

1. Add standard activities under each WBS section as needed
2. Include Activity ID and Name for each activity
3. Use standard activities from the library:
   a. VDC/BIM Development
   b. Procurement
   c. Set Equipment
   d. Install Conduits / Raceway
   e. Pull Cable
   f. Terminate Cable
   g. Lighting / Lighting Controls
   h. Fire Alarm System
   i. Security & Sound System
   j. Install Devices & Trim
   k. Quality Checks & Inspections
   l. Test and Commissioning
4. Customize standard activities as needed to match project-specific requirements

## Determine Activity ID and Naming Conventions

1. Establish Activity ID and Naming conventions that align with project and ArchKey standards
2. Ensure Activity IDs are unique and follow a consistent format
3. Consider Activity Codes (alphanumeric values for grouping and filtering activities) in addition to Activity IDs
4. Use clear, descriptive activity names that indicate the work being performed
5. Apply naming conventions consistently across all activities in the loader sheet

## Add Activity Details

1. Add duration for each activity based on scope, crew size, and historical data
2. Add crew size for each activity to support resource planning
3. Add labor hours for each activity, aligning with the estimate where applicable
4. Ensure durations, crew sizes, and labor hours are realistic and consistent

## Add Logic Ties

1. Add Activity Relationships (logic ties) for each activity by defining predecessor and/or successor relationships
2. Use the four relationship types as appropriate: Finish-to-Start (FS), Start-to-Start (SS), Finish-to-Finish (FF), or Start-to-Finish (SF)
3. Ensure Activity Relationships reflect the proper sequence of work
4. Link activities to show dependencies between tasks
5. Verify Activity Relationships create a logical flow of work from start to finish

## Include Subcontractor Activities

1. Include subcontractor activities in the loader sheet
2. Ensure PM & Field Team from subcontractors are included in the process
3. Coordinate with subcontractors to obtain accurate activity information, durations, and Activity Relationships
4. Integrate subcontractor activities with ArchKey internal activities to show proper sequencing and dependencies
