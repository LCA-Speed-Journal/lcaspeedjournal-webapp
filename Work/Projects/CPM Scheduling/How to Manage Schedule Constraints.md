# How to Manage Schedule Constraints

Schedule constraints are date restrictions imposed on an activity's start or finish date in scheduling software, or external factors that prevent work from being completed as planned (such as permitting delays, material availability, labor shortages, or space limitations). Properly identifying, documenting, and communicating constraints helps prevent delays and supports change management.

## Identify Constraints During Planning

1. Review upcoming activities in the contract schedule to identify potential constraints
2. Consult with Field Leaders about site conditions and access limitations that may impact work
3. Consider common constraint types: permitting, inspections, labor availability, limited work access/space constraints, weather conditions, material delivery dates, and owner-furnished equipment
4. Evaluate tasks not completed during previous look-ahead windows to determine if constraints prevented completion
5. Use look-ahead meetings to identify constraints that could prevent the completion of upcoming tasks

## Document Constraints in Constraint Log

1. Maintain a Constraint Log that tracks all identified constraints
2. Update the Constraint Log weekly during look-ahead planning meetings
3. Document each constraint with: description of the constraint, affected activities or tasks, potential impact on schedule, responsible party (if applicable), and status/resolution plan
4. Include constraints identified during look-ahead meetings that could prevent completion of upcoming tasks
5. Ensure the Constraint Log is accessible to the PM team and Field Leaders

## Integrate Constraints into Schedule

1. Ensure the schedule aligns with contractual milestones while accounting for constraints
2. Include constraints in the schedule when using CPM scheduling: add constraint types (start no earlier than, finish no later than, start on, finish on, mandatory start, mandatory finish) to affected activities. Constraints will swap computed dates to dates imposed by the user
3. Work with the Scheduler to determine if the Project Schedule needs to be updated based on identified constraints
4. Note that constraint resolution may require sequencing changes that need to be incorporated into the project schedule

## Communicate Constraints to GC and Stakeholders

1. Share the Constraint Log with the GC during weekly look-ahead meetings
2. Communicate priority issues to the GC in person or over the phone, then follow up by emailing the Constraint Log
3. Clearly explain how constraints impact the schedule and what support is needed from the GC or other trades
4. Offer suggestions to the GC to improve the schedule or resolve constraints: if you don't ask, they won't know you prefer something different
5. Coordinate with all parties to ensure the schedule aligns with start/finish dates and durations that work well for the ArchKey team

## Monitor and Update Constraint Status

1. Review constraint status weekly during look-ahead planning
2. Update the Constraint Log as constraints are resolved or new ones are identified
3. Remove resolved constraints from active tracking while maintaining a record for historical reference
4. Escalate unresolved constraints that are impacting Critical Path activities or major milestones
