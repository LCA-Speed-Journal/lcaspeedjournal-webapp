L3 Schedule Development Playbook (Using Internal P6) 

 

 

**Step 1: Review Project Scope** 

* Understand project scope of work, contract documents, specifications, drawings, proposal clarifications, etc. 

 

**Step 2: Gather All Required Information** 

* Save a copy of the **Resource Curve Template** in the project folder for version control.   
* Collect:   
* **Hours to be worked per week** (standard or project-specific).   
* **Major milestone dates** from the GC schedule.   
* **Electrical activities** listed in the GC schedule.   
* **WBS structure** from GC to understand how the project will be tracked at a high level (areas, systems, floors, etc.).   
* **Accubid estimate**, including internal subs (technology, civil, etc.) if they are part of the resource curve.   
* **Lessons learned** from similar projects   
* **Lead times / Delivery dates** for material, equipment, and Owner furnished equipment**.**   
* **Takt Maps** that show sequence and flow of work   
* **Determine Activity ID and Naming** conventions   
* **Risk Register (if available)**   
* Verify that all data sources (GC schedule, estimate, WBS) are the latest versions to avoid rework later.

**Step 3: Setup P6 File**  

* Provide Scheduler with WBS structure   
* Scheduler creates framework for project in P6 

 

**Step 4: Create Activity Listing** 

* Review repository of fragnets and example schedules for applicability.  Use if available.   
* Use Level 1 schedule activities as basis for building L3 activities if applicable.  L3 activities can roll up to the L1 activities.   
* Save a copy of Schedule Loader sheet template   
* Add GC milestones   
* Copy fragnets, sample activities, or L1 activities into loader sheet as starting point.   
* Add standard activities under each WBS section as needed    
* Include Activity ID and Name   
* Standard Activities:   
* VDC/BIM Development   
* Procurement   
* Set Equipment   
* Install Conduits / Raceway   
* Pull Cable    
* Terminate Cable   
* Lighting / Lighting Controls   
* Fire Alarm System   
* Security & Sound System   
* Install Devices & Trim   
* Quality Checks & Inspections   
* Test and Commissioning   
* Add duration, crew size, and labor hours for each activity   
* Add logic tie for each activity (predecessor and/or successor)   
* Include subcontractor activities (include PM & Field Team from sub in process)

**Step 5: Import Loader into P6 and Analyze** 

* Scheduler imports loader sheet and does initial analysis 

**Step 6: Incorporate Risk & Contingencies** 

* Assess potential risks, such as weather delays, labor shortages, or material supply issues.  Reference Risk Log   
* Add contingency durations for critical activities or phases to account for uncertainty. 

**Step 7: Integrate Milestones & Constraints** 

* Ensure schedule aligns with contractual milestones.   
* Include any constraints like permitting, inspections, labor availability, limited work access/space constraints, weather conditions, etc. 

**Step 8: Review and Validate Schedule** 

* PM & Field Team to review with Scheduler.  Things to consider:   
* Is overall duration within project milestones?   
* The sequence of activities should make sense, and there should be no out-of-sequence activities   
* Ensure that all identified activities will cover the whole contractual scope   
* What is peak labor?  Aligned with estimate?   
* Is labor curve smooth?  Are there peaks and valleys?   
* Are ramp up/down rates reasonable?   
* Review with Subcontractors, Vendors, and GC.   
* Coordinate with all parties to make sure schedule aligns with start/finish dates and durations that work well for us.     
* Offer suggestions to GC to improve schedule.  If we don’t ask, they won’t know we prefer something different. 

**Step 9: Finalize and Distribute Schedule** 

* Finalize and publish the baseline.     
* Create an S-Curve to represent the baseline.  This will be used for Planned, Earned, Spent tracking.   
* Typically easier to use Excel to ensure a smooth, flat curve.  P6 tends to be too jagged when producing resource curve   
* Distribute to Subcontractors, Vendors, and GC   
* Ensure all team members understand their roles, responsibilities, and deadlines.   
* Takt maps can be an effective way to communicate milestones, sequencing of work, crew assignments, etc.   
* know we prefer something different. 

**Step 10: Monitor and Update the Schedule During Execution** 

* Regularly update the schedule with actual start and finish dates, percent completes, and any delays or changes.   
* Monitor variances between planned (baseline) and actual progress to identify issues early.   
* Updated PES (????) curves can be used to help with this.   
* Incorporate  changes (e.g., scope changes, delays, of accelerations).  Re-baseline if necessary   
* Generate short-term schedules to guide look-ahead planning. 

**Step 11: Mitigate Delays** 

* Use the schedule to identify activities causing delays, especially those on the critical path.   
* Coordinate with GC to develop strategies to recover lost time, such as resequencing activities, adding resources, or working overtime.   
* Create new S-curve illustrating the recovery plan and compare to baseline S-Curve.  Overlay the curves to identify impacts and to quantify or monetize the change.
