Scheduling Glossary 

 

**Activity:** A task or process to be accomplished in a set period of time as part of working toward a larger project goal. An Activity can be assigned to a resource(s) and have an associated cost. Activities are ordered with logic links. 

**Activity Code:** An alphanumeric value by which activities can be grouped and filtered. A code is assigned to each activity. 

**Activity Relationship:** An ordered link between 2 activities representing the order of execution. There 4 relationship types are:   
FS – Finish to Start SS – Start to Start FF – Finish to Finish SF – Start to Finish   
   
**Baseline Schedule:** A Baseline Schedule is a fixed CPM schedule that reflects the original scope of work for the project, and the Contractors’ intended sequence for completing the original scope of work that is the standard by which project performance is measured.   
   
**Constraint:** A date restriction imposed on an activity’s start or finish date in scheduling software. Applying a constraint will swap the computed date to a date imposed by the user. Often used to imposed deadlines or to delay activities in a schedule.   
   
**Contract Completion Date:** The date established by the Contract for completion of all work for the project. 

**Critical Activity:** An activity that is on the project’s critical path.   
   
**Critical Path:** The critical path is the longest continuous path of activities through the contractual completion milestones in the CPM schedule that establishes the project scheduled completion date. The critical path is typically the path of activities with the least total float. The critical path may follow different paths of activities at different times during the performance of the work due to the progress of the work or revisions made to the schedule. Any operation on the critical path is a Controlling Operation. 

**Current Schedule:** The latest approved Schedule.   
   
**Data date**: A data date, also called an as-of date, is a point at which a project’s status is measured and documented. It separates actual data from scheduled data.   
   
**Duration:** The number of calendar periods it takes (or is estimated to take) from the time the execution of an element starts to the moment it is completed. 

**Finish-To-Start:** In a finish-to-start relationship, a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has finished.   
   
**Finish-To-Finish**: In a finish-to-finish relationship, a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has finished.
