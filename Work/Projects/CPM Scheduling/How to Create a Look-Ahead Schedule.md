# How to Create a Look-Ahead Schedule

A look-ahead schedule is a weekly short-term planning tool that breaks down upcoming work into manageable tasks, helping coordinate on-site activities, optimize resource allocation, and ensure timely completion of project milestones.

## Determine Tool to be Used for Look-Ahead Planning

1. Select a planning tool: suggested options include Master Work Package List (for projects using work packaging) or Labor Tracking Sheet
2. When possible, utilize a tool already being developed on the project to reduce the number of spreadsheets
3. Ensure the spreadsheet has enough work packages or activities developed in advance: if the look-ahead duration is 6 weeks, the tool should have enough content to cover at least 6 weeks, but ideally 12 weeks or more
4. Note that spreadsheets may be developed over time as work packages are defined throughout the project

## Gather All Required Information

1. Review and collect weekly the following information and verify their accuracy:
   a. S-Curve (Planned, Earned, Spent) curve
   b. Contract schedule milestones
   c. Contract schedule look-ahead report (export to Excel if possible)
   d. Labor Tracking sheet, Master Work Package List, or similar tool used for breaking down the project and tracking labor progress
   e. Template to summarize look-ahead activities
   f. Constraint Log

## Review Contract Schedule

1. Review upcoming activities from the Current Schedule (scheduler to run report)
2. Ensure each row in the planning tool is associated with a schedule activity
3. Transfer start/finish dates for each activity in the schedule to the planning tool to assist with prioritization
4. Review all upcoming milestones to ensure alignment with planned work
5. Enter information in the look-ahead planning tool to prepare for the planning meeting

## Conduct Look-Ahead Meeting

1. PM Team member and Field Leader meet to review upcoming work
2. Review upcoming work based on the Current Schedule
3. Consult with Field Leader for upcoming work based on field progress and site conditions
4. Identify activities for the upcoming look-ahead window
5. Evaluate tasks not completed during the previous window to determine if they should remain on the plan
6. Note that constraints may prevent work from being completed, and tasks may drop off the look-ahead plan
7. Use estimated hours and crew size to help determine the appropriate amount of work for each crew
8. Determine dependencies and sequencing
9. Assign crews (foreman) to each task
10. Identify constraints

## Update Look-Ahead Plan

1. Use information from the look-ahead meeting to update the planning tool
2. Update the look-ahead planning tool based on discussions during the meeting with the field leader
3. Update the look-ahead plan to include all work to be performed during the look-ahead window
4. Update the Constraint Log to include anything identified that could prevent the completion of an upcoming task
5. Work with the Scheduler to determine if the Project Schedule needs to be updated
6. Note that the look-ahead plan could change sequencing and may need to be incorporated into the project schedule

## Distribute Plan

1. Distribute to PM team, Field Leaders, GC, Subs, other trades, and vendors as appropriate
2. Use to communicate the plan in weekly GC look-ahead meetings
3. Share the Constraint Log and communicate priority issues to GC: this should be done in person or over the phone, followed up by emailing the Constraint Log

## Update Progress

1. Update progress weekly to determine actual work completed
2. Update any related reporting, such as percentage of work packages completed as planned
3. Repeat the process starting at Gather All Required Information
