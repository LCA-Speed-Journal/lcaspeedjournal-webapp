L1 Schedule Development Playbook (Using Resource Curve Template) 

 

**Step 1: Gather All Required Information** 

* Save a copy of the **Resource Curve Template** in the project folder for version control.   
* Collect:   
* **Hours to be worked per week** (standard or project-specific).   
* **Major milestone dates** from the GC schedule.   
* **Electrical activities** listed in the GC schedule.   
* **WBS structure** from GC to understand how the project will be tracked at a high level (areas, systems, floors, etc.).   
* **Accubid estimate**, including internal subs (technology, civil, etc.) if they are part of the resource curve.   
* Verify that all data sources (GC schedule, estimate, WBS) are the latest versions to avoid rework.

**Step 2: Determine Activities for the L1 Schedule** 

* Review **WBS and GC schedule activities**.   
* Identify how the project will be tracked at a high level (by area, system, floor, etc.).   
* If unclear, create a logical breakdown aligned with the estimate and bid form.   
* Keep the number of activities small—the goal is resource planning, not a full contract schedule.   
* Confirm the activity breakdown with the PM team and Field Leadership to ensure alignment with field execution strategy.

**Step 3: Load Activity Data into Resource Curve Template** 

* Enter **activity names** into the template.   
* Enter **hours per week** to be worked.   
* Export **labor hours from Accubid**:   
* Export the **Extension screen to Excel**.   
* Group line items to align with activities.   
* Add a column for activity names if needed.   
* Use a **Pivot Table** to summarize hours by activity.   
* Add **indirect hours** (supervision, cleanup, orientation, labor factors) using multipliers.   
* Separate hours for each trade if necessary.  It might be important to graph resources for each trade and then aggregate together for an overall resrouce curve.   
* Double-check that total hours in the template match the estimate total before proceeding.

**Step 4: Assign Start and Finish Dates** 

* Use **GC milestones and activities** as a guide.   
* If GC schedule doesn’t align, use best judgment based on our field leadership’s strategy.   
* Review **average crew sizes**:   
* If crew size seems unrealistic, adjust dates to flatten the curve.   
* Cross-check with procurement and long-lead items to ensure start dates are achievable.

**Step 5: Review and Adjust Resource Curve** 

* Refresh **Pivot Tables** to generate the initial curve.   
* Look for:   
* Spikes or steep ramp-up/down rates.   
* Unrealistic workforce peaks.   
* Adjust start/finish dates (while maintaining GC milestones) to smooth the curve.   
* Validate the curve with the PM team and Field Leadership to confirm it matches field expectations and workforce availability.

**Step 6: Finalize and Save** 

* Save the **final Resource Curve file** in the project folder.   
* Share with PM team, Field Leadership, and estimating team for alignment.   
* Document key assumptions (crew sizes, work hours, indirect factors) in a notes tab for future reference.

**Step 7: Use the Curve for Planning** 

* Use the curve to:   
* Forecast **labor needs**.   
* Support **look-ahead schedules**.   
* Identify **risk areas** (e.g., workforce shortages).   
* Update the curve if major scope changes occur or if GC milestones shift.
