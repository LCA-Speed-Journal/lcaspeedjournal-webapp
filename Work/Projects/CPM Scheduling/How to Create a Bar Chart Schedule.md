# How to Create a Bar Chart Schedule

A bar chart schedule (Gantt chart) provides a visual timeline for project activities using Excel templates, helping teams plan work based on milestone dates and forecast crew sizes and durations.

## Receive and Review Contract Baseline Schedule

1. Obtain the contract Baseline Schedule from the general contractor (GC) or client
2. Review the schedule with the PM team and field lead
3. Verify that the schedule aligns with schedule terms in ArchKey's subcontract, including milestones and any Critical Path requirements
4. Identify missing scope items, unrealistic durations, or sequencing issues

## Download and Setup Your Project Template

1. Open ArchKey's approved scheduling template in the designated application (Excel Project File)
2. Use the Scheduling Method Decision Tree to determine which file to use
3. Confirm project information: project name, job number, location, client, and contract details
4. Set up calendars (period, workdays, holidays, overtime rules)
5. Input coding structures (Cost codes, Activity Codes, activity IDs, WBS codes)
6. Save the template to the schedule folder on SharePoint

## Review the Schedule and Extract Milestone Dates

1. Extract milestone dates from the Baseline Schedule, including: Notice to Proceed, Inspections, Substantial Completion, TCO, Final Completion, Certificate of Occupancy, and other contractual milestones
2. Highlight GC/Owner driven milestones, interim milestones, and internal handoff dates
3. Flag milestones that may have dependencies outside your control, such as permits or equipment delivery

## Populate Your Template with All Project Milestones

1. Enter milestone activities with correct start and finish dates
2. Assign milestone types (Start Milestone, Finish Milestone)

## Populate Key Electrical, Fire Alarm, Data, and Low-Voltage System Activities

1. Review the Baseline Schedule for key tasks
2. Add all relevant electrical scopes: temporary power, feeder installation, fire alarm backbone, data cabling, security systems, sound systems, lighting controls, and other low-voltage systems
3. Input planned start dates, finish dates, and durations as shown in the GC's Baseline Schedule
4. Review activity durations for reasonableness
5. Review for out-of-sequence activities and address any issues

## Input All Key Project Tasks

1. Add major trade activities: conduit installation, wire pulling, switchgear setting, lighting installation, fire alarm testing, commissioning
2. Sequence tasks logically to reflect construction flow
3. Assign durations and link activities using Activity Relationships (Finish-to-Start, Start-to-Start, Finish-to-Finish, or Start-to-Finish)
4. Work backwards from milestones: for each milestone, define prerequisite tasks
5. Input preceding activities step-by-step until you reach early-phase tasks

## Review the Schedule with Your Project Team

1. Conduct a review meeting with the PM team and field lead
2. Walk through milestones, durations, sequences, and assumptions
3. Document feedback and incorporate adjustments, such as longer durations, crew size changes, or added testing
4. Resolve conflicts with subcontractors and other trades' schedules where possible
5. Obtain the GC's approval on the schedule adjustments

## Publish the Schedule to the Entire Team

1. Finalize the approved schedule in the scheduling software/template
2. Export schedule into required formats (PDF, Excel, native file)
3. Distribute to field leadership, project staff, and client as required
4. Post key milestone charts or lookahead schedules in job trailers or shared platforms for visibility

## Schedule Updates, Version Control, and Review Cadence

1. Never overwrite or delete an existing schedule file
2. Always use "Save As" to create a new version when making updates
3. Include version identifiers in the file name, such as ProjectName_Schedule_v1_2025-11-10.xlsx
4. Store all versions in the designated SharePoint schedule folder for traceability
5. Maintain a clear version history for auditing and reference
6. Document major changes, such as milestone shifts or Activity Relationship changes, in a change log or notes section within the schedule file
7. Perform schedule impact analysis for any additional costs or time, and communicate the results to relevant stakeholders
8. Conduct regular schedule review meetings with the project team: weekly for active projects with frequent changes, bi-weekly or monthly for other projects
9. Review progress against milestones, update actuals, and adjust future activities as needed
10. Confirm alignment with GC/Owner updates and other trades' schedules
