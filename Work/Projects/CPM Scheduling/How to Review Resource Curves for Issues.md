# How to Review Resource Curves for Issues

Reviewing resource curves helps identify unrealistic workforce peaks, problematic ramp rates, and scheduling conflicts that could impact project execution. Regular curve analysis ensures the schedule is achievable and aligns with available workforce.

## Generate Initial Resource Curve

1. Refresh Pivot Tables in the Resource Curve Template to generate the initial curve
2. Review the graphical representation of workforce levels over the project timeline
3. Identify the overall shape of the curve and note any obvious anomalies

## Identify Spikes and Steep Ramp Rates

1. Look for spikes in the resource curve that indicate unrealistic workforce peaks
2. Identify steep ramp-up rates that may be difficult to achieve given hiring and onboarding timelines
3. Identify steep ramp-down rates that may indicate inefficient resource allocation
4. Note any sudden increases or decreases in workforce that don't align with project phases

## Assess Workforce Peak Reasonableness

1. Compare peak workforce levels to available workforce and historical project data
2. Evaluate whether peak levels are achievable given crew availability and hiring constraints
3. Consider if peak levels align with the estimate and field leadership expectations
4. Identify peaks that may cause resource shortages or require unrealistic crew sizes

## Adjust Start and Finish Dates to Smooth Curve

1. Adjust start/finish dates for activities while maintaining GC milestones to smooth the curve
2. Consider starting some work earlier if coordination with the GC allows: this can help minimize peak workforce and create a flatter curve
3. Evaluate if extending some activity durations can help flatten peaks
4. Work backwards from milestones to identify activities that can be shifted without impacting critical dates
5. Make incremental adjustments and refresh the curve to see the impact

## Validate Curve with Project Team

1. Validate the adjusted curve with the PM team and Field Leadership
2. Confirm the curve matches field expectations and workforce availability
3. Review crew sizes and ensure they are realistic for the work being performed
4. Discuss any concerns about resource availability during peak periods
5. Obtain team approval before finalizing the resource curve

## Document Key Assumptions

1. Document crew sizes used in the curve calculations
2. Record work hours per week assumptions
3. Note indirect factors and multipliers applied
4. Document any assumptions about early starts or sequencing changes
5. Save these assumptions in a notes tab for future reference and schedule updates
