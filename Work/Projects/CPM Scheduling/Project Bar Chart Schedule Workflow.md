**Project Bar Chart Schedule Workflow**   
**1\. Receive and Review Contract Baseline Schedule with Project Team** 

* **Why:** Shared understanding of schedule expectations and documentation of any discrepancies, constraints, or risks.   
* **What:** Establish a clear understanding of the project schedule requirements, milestones, constraints, and deliverables.   
* **How:**   
* Obtain the contract baseline schedule from the general contractor (GC) or client.   
* Review the schedule with the PM team and field lead.   
* Verify that the schedule aligns with schedule terms in our subcontract, including milestones and any critical path requirements.   
* Identify missing scope items, unrealistic durations, or sequencing issues. 

   
**2\. Download and Setup Your Project (Template)** 

* **Why:** A ready to use scheduling environment tailored to the project.   
* **What:** Create a consistent and standardized project scheduling environment.   
* **How:**   
* Open the company’s approved scheduling template in the designated application (Excel Project File)(Use the Scheduling Method Decision Tree to figure out which file to use).   
* Confirm project information: project name, job number, location, client, and contract details.   
* Set up calendars (period, workdays, holidays, overtime rules).   
* Input coding structures (Cost codes, activity IDs, etc.).   
* Save to schedule folder on SharePoint 

   
**3\. Review the Schedule and Pull Out All Milestone Dates** 

* **Why:** A list of milestone dates that form the backbone of your scheduling plan.   
* **What:** Identify the non-negotiable deadlines that drive the rest of the project plan.   
* **How:**   
* Extract milestone dates from the baseline schedule (e.g., Notice to Proceed, Inspections, Substantial Completion, TCO, etc.).   
* Highlight GC/Owner driven milestones, interim milestones, and internal handoff dates.   
* Flag milestones that may have dependencies outside your control (permits, equipment delivery). 

   
**4\. Populate Your Template/Application with All Project Milestones** 

* **Why:** Milestones loaded into the schedule software as anchor points for detailed planning.   
* **What:** Establish the framework of the schedule before adding detailed activities.   
* **How:**   
* Enter milestone activities with correct start and finish dates.   
* Assign milestone types (Start Milestone, Finish Milestone). 

   
**5\. Populate Key Electrical, Fire Alarm, Data, etc. Activities** 

* **Why:** All system level tasks mapped into the project schedule for visibility and tracking.   
* **What:** Ensure all major system scopes are represented in the schedule.   
* **How:**   
* Review the baseline schedule for key tasks.   
* Add all relevant electrical scopes: temporary power, feeder installation, fire alarm backbone, data cabling, low-voltage systems, etc.   
* Input planned start dates, finish dates, and durations as shown in the GC’s baseline.   
* Cross check activity durations for reasonableness.   
* Cross check for out-of-sequence activities (address it if there is any) 

   
**6\. Input All Key Project Tasks** 

* **Why:** A logically sequenced, resource-loaded schedule that accurately reflects execution needs.   
* **What:** Build out the detail-level tasks that will drive field execution.   
* **How:**   
* Add major trade activities (conduit installation, wire pulling, switchgear setting, lighting installation, fire alarm testing, commissioning).   
* Sequence tasks logically to reflect construction flow.   
* Assign durations and link activities (predecessor/successor relationships).   
* **Work Backwards from Milestones:**   
* For each milestone (e.g., "Permanent Power"), define prerequisite tasks.   
* Input preceding activities step-by-step until you reach early-phase tasks. 

   
   
   
**7\. Review the Schedule with Your Project Team** 

* **Why:** Team approved schedule that reflects real-world constraints and has full buy-in.   
* **What:** Validate accuracy, improve buy-in, and identify overlooked items.   
* **How:**   
* Conduct a review meeting with the PM team and field lead.   
* Walk through milestones, durations, sequences, and assumptions.   
* Document feedback and incorporate adjustments (e.g., longer durations, crew size changes, added testing).   
* Resolve conflicts with subcontractors and other trades’ schedules where possible.   
* Get the GC’s approval on the schedule adjustments 

   
**8\. Publish the Schedule to the Entire Team** 

* **Why:** A fully published, accessible schedule that serves as the project’s roadmap.   
* **What:** Ensure all project team members are working from the same, consistent schedule.   
* **How:**   
* Finalize the approved schedule in the scheduling software/template.   
* Export schedule into required formats (PDF, Excel, native file).   
* Distribute to field leadership, project staff, and client as required.   
* Post key milestone charts or lookahead schedules in job trailers or shared platforms for visibility.   
   

**9\. Schedule Updates, Version Control, and Review Cadence** 

* **Why:** Consistent updates and structured reviews prevent misalignment, reduce risk, and ensure the schedule remains a reliable roadmap for execution.   
* **What:** Maintain schedule integrity, ensure transparency, and keep the team aligned throughout the project lifecycle.   
* **How:**   
* Updating & Saving:    
* Never overwrite or delete an existing schedule file.   
* Always use “Save As” to create a new version when making updates.   
* Include version identifiers in the file name (e.g., ProjectName\_Schedule\_v1\_2025-11-10.xlsx).   
* Store all versions in the designated SharePoint schedule folder for traceability.   
* Version Control:    
* Maintain a clear version history for auditing and reference.   
* Document major changes (e.g., milestone shifts, logic changes) in a change log or notes section within the schedule file.   
* Perform schedule impact analysis for any additional costs or time, and communicate the results to relevant stakeholders (e.g., PMs, GC)   
* Review Meeting Cadence:    
* Conduct regular schedule review meetings with the project team:    
* Weekly for active projects with frequent changes.   
* Bi-weekly or monthly for projects.   
* Review progress against milestones, update actuals, and adjust future activities as needed.   
* Confirm alignment with GC/Owner updates and other trades’ schedules.
