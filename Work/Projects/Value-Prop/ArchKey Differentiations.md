### Estimation
Cost estimating systems are essential to ensuring accurate and effective budget management. The system that is most appropriate for cost-modeling varies. As the design refines, so do the estimating systems utilized to assess potential project costs.
#### Highlights
- Deploy Various Estimating Tools that are ‘right-sized’ for the level of design detail
	- Conceptual budgets utilizing historical market sector cost data
	- Schematic/Narrative system budgets
	- Detailed takeoff Estimates
- Utilize a suite of industry-standard Trimble software solutions for its detailed cost estimating
	- Accubid Classic Estimating
	- Trimble LiveCount Electronic Takeoff
	- Trimble Trade-Service (TRA-SER) Commodity Pricing
- Using these tools, ArchKey can produce robust estimates that provide detailed, comprehensive cost summaries and granular, multilevel cost breakdowns
### Value Engineering by Work Packaging
Plan by Work Package → Schedule by Work Package → Track by Work Package
- Advanced Work Packaging (AWP): A construction-driven planning and collaboration system for building capital projects that is sharply focused on creating a constraint-free work environment.
- Construction Work Packages (CWP): Highest level work package. Identified by type of work. Overhead Conduit, Cable Tray, Grounding, etc.
- Installation Work Packages (IWP): Smallest Type of work package on a project. It contains a scope of works that allow the specific crew to operate independently for a specified period.
- Workforce Planning (WFP): The process of breaking down the high-level CWP’s into discrete IWO’s for execution in the field. Typically known as workflow.
