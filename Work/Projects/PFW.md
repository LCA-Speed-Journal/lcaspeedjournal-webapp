# Basic Overview
The biggest initiative affecting the field that we have currently at AK.
Massive impact to PMs — this is the tool that can lead to their continued employment, or not.
Key tracking for all important values on a project, setting up projects, and managing them over the project lifecycle with the proper chains of approval for things like change-orders, etc.
# Anticipated Timeline
##### August
**Late:** Ops Leads decide if new UAT dates are correct → New Super-User Session with revised expectations → App Development Complete (8/29)
##### September
**Mid:** Exec Preview → UAT (Division Controllers) → UAT 1 (Super-Users, 9/17-19)
**Late:** UAT 2 (Super-Users, 9/29-30)
##### October
**Early:** Comms to all end-users → UAT 3 (Super-Users, limited, fixing/retesting, 10/6-10)
**Mid:** Job Profile Go-Live (10/13) → eLearning Release-Date (10/13-17)
**Late:** ILT (Active CAC & PFW Users, 10/20-24) → Go-Live (10/27)
