# Big Notes
- Megan K is part of L&D now!
- Steven has been promoted to VP of Talent Management
## Reviewing the SLT Slides
### Financials
- We’re profitable, we’re pushing in a good direction, we’re on track
	- M&A: Partner coming on board soon, expect to gain more over the next 4yrs
	- Projected $4B by 2028
- **Headcount:** not concern, not hesitancy, but need to find the right pace
	- Might be swimming in work now, but will likely be able to hold onto employees for longer if we’re a little more patient
	- (may acquire a company with existing comms or L&D team)
A lot of the current things coming in is related to data-centers, that’s getting bigger and bigger
### Key Themes from the Board Meeting
**Organizational Maturation and Development:** that’s us, dealing a lot with knowledge capture, writing down SOP’s and standardizing processes
**Talent Planning:** 9Box, Succession Planning, High-Potential Program and IDP’s, Quarterly Talent-Meetings

### Full-Potential Workstreams
- ~30% of the FPP projects connect on **Labor**

### Important Pieces:
**[[Safety]]:** potentially bringing someone onto our L&D team, currently they’re all somewhat producing training → thought would be if we get one dedicated it frees up the others, and then they can help us with other tangential projects
	Potentially doing more for **Psychological Safety** on the jobsite, there’s a lot done on the physical side but there isn’t as much on the psych-sided

### Field Training (Currently, Andrew’s Piece)
**Foremen** and **Superintendents** *will* be in Bridge. Not an if, a when.
Zero chance the current admins of field training will be Bridge-admins.
	Currently, we can’t track the stuff. That’s an issue.
	- N Central is a big problem in the numbers-side of the world

### SLT Committee Updates
#### Updating the Core Values
> “In most organizations, people only remember the first and the last core-value.” → [[Values, Mission Statements]]
1. **People First:**
2. **Guided by Integrity:**
3. **Embracing the Edge:**
4. **Own the Outcome:**
5. **Safety Without Compromise:**

## Strategy on a Page (SOAP)
**It’s clearer now!**

## Scorecard Conversation
How does the scorecard play with the [[PFW]], plays with the [[PM Dashboard]]
	One doesn’t always work, one doesn’t exist
Currently, will be based on all of our things: training, performance review, etc.

## Talent Development
**The *work* is People.**
We’re ahead of things on the engagement side, beyond the industry standard
	We might be a little hard on it as L&D, but that’s because we’re us
We need to continue to support Bridge, it’s a powerful tool and we just need to keep championing it to the company to show it’s *value*.
	There were a few moments about people not knowing what to do in their [[1:1’s]]
A lot of people coming down the pipe for retirement, who don’t have successors. That’s an issue, it puts us in a precarious situation.


# Existing Questions, Hurdles, Hangups
### Lack of a Good Internal Tool
*SharePoint isn’t great. Hard to understand audience-breakdown, can’t track a lot of the analytics, etc.*
	Could we use **Teams?**
### Tracking Tool
Part Asana, part Bridge-Goals
