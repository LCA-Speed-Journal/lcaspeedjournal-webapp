# Folder-Structure
- 3 Primary Folders: Audio – Assets – Storyline
# Templates
## Audio
- Adding “Voice Settings” to the storyboard
	- Speaker, Pitch/Speed Adjustments, etc.
## Job-Aids
Portrait Job-Aid: couldn’t hurt, but 
Date at Bottom: 
## Storyboards
Revamping for Audio-Details, removing the design-notes element
## Storyline
Closed-Captioning: not an immediate need, but thinking long-term about accessibility and potential concerns
## SOPs
On the list for things in the future, but not an immediate concern
# Fonts
Railway matches roughly with BR Firma. 
Currently don’t have anything regarding “this for this heading, this for this, etc.”
Only concern about non-standard fonts is they can appear odd if the learner doesn’t have downloaded.
	When embedded (PDF, Storyline export, etc) doesn’t have issues
