# Quick Top-of-Meeting: Updates
## PFW 
Waiting on 2nd week of UAT
## FPPs
SD going to help reach out to our stakeholders in all these initiatives, already written, going to basically tee up the ball for us to follow up with
- There are a handful of projects that are more IT heavy — Perficient consultants might be the managers on those (…yippee)
- 2 Things to keep in mind if the consultant is leading:
	- Friends Close, Enemies Closer
	- eg. Eric is to work with Bill Gavin for a database. Working with Bill Gavin, not thru the consultant. We work with the initiative owner, they’re present by proxy but they shouldn’t be funneling things.
### *Eric Q: What’s the precedent?*
Have had problems in the past, consultants telling us to either not reach out to the leader, or to run comms through them. That’s…an issue.
A lot of them have shown that tendency, but one or two have been…a little more direct about it (the individual who was the most egregious in that is…no longer employed by AK. :LiSmile: )
