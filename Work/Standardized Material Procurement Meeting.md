Talking through small and medium projects:
- Would like to see some form of a Jotform — big lift coming on the horizon is to find a replacement for INRS
	- “Material Requisition Form” rather than a Jotform, nominal reference
	- Need to find a tool that allows for this form to be generated within the tool (nothing beyond basic information: Job Name, Cost-Code, etc.)
- For Medium-Size, a little more flexible: can still have some pretty-good BOM
	- Would like to get a copy of the BOM, would likely come through some kind of electronic communication (clear instructions via Email, Excel-Spreadsheet, etc.)

1. Get Estimate out of Accubid — get 3 Bids and a Buy
2. Once PO is placed for that package (5 uniques) — low, medium, tray, lighting, gear
	1. Execute Purchase-Order
3. Once field is ready to execute on the buckets, would fill out the Jotform, send over to Dan G., and he would release the package from wherever it was bought from

In a lot of small orders, PMs will find their own vendors using the Mobile-PO App (don’t want to waste Procurement time for $5k worth of wire, etc.)

Not going to address the service-PM or service procedure in this, that information will be coming from service.

## Jotform
After doing the initial buy-out, PM works with Procurement to do the big buy-outs: as things need released, we’d fill out the Jtoform to release the equipment, and the email would be sent out to whoever needs the information.
- Goes to a Central Comms location
- Might even turn into something like the IT Help-Desk (vague, but yes)
	- Universal Jotform for smaller jotforms. Right now, unique forms for each big project with prepopulated information to help save time. 

In Procurement’s perfect world: need a form that’s integrated into the procurement system, utilize that for the small-med projects:

Look at AK Central and Clint’s integration of forms within ProjectPlace and Asana, as well as Jason S and his work with PEC to help work on this process
- Slowly moving, at a national level, to Asana rather than ProjectPlace, as it has more functionality
- Jason has the same process as the national, should look here.

West: unsure about what has been created so far.

**Workshop coming up in the next week or two??**

- Our FPP will write out initial buy-out, laid out with gear, lighting, etc. (big items), and from that portion we’ll have an electronic form to submit into centralized procurement for further orders
	- Leaves room int he future for how things develop with the specifics of the tool, etc. (if Asana, moving to an internal board, swim-lanes, etc.)

Tom wants to move away from 4-5 different boards/locations, and migrate towards things being centralized and universal

Need to communicate about not taking the tasks on by yourself as the PM
- We know they like control, they want to manage their projects the best their can, but Procurement needs to have some control to help increase additional savings and efficiency
- Procurement often has information about how companies are working on multiple projects, and diversifying business to help optimize service as well
	- if Graybar has 2 other projects in their backlog and we add more orders on top, might not get the best service as compared to using a different vendor who might have a higher amount of bandwidth

Process is currently being written from the perspective referenced above.

Main Goal: direct to Procurement, and let them
