# Key Summary
Need to know how many senior leaders (how we can split it up)
“They” can execute logistics-things if we tell them what they need to do.
We need to present what our role is in UAT so that the expectation is there up front. 
# What do we need
Biggest need is system access and logistics (calendar invites, etc). 
## Design Team
- Need a Working Tool
- Need a Sandbox Environment (**Confirmed that we will have one**)
	- Have our topics, but would like to be able to actually capture content and use it — that requires the tool
Ben and Krista/Polly have been working on modules for UAT (everything they want to test). We’re looking at those for our sims, and figuring out tasks from those.
## ILT Team
Facilitator guide is more of “topic needed to be hit, and here’s the timing”
	Rough guardrails, need to remind them not to lose their audience by “being a SME” and lecturing beyond what’s needed for the learner.
Not a ton of people willing to train an actual session, but are happy to help wherever **else** they can.
### SD’s High-Level Thoughts on ILT
1. review the prework - eLearning to make sure everyone understood 
	(SHORT amount of time)
2. Everyone walks through a job in sandbox tell/show/do/review 
	(BIGGEST BULK)
3. Expectations on “when I use the PFW”
	(Leaders committed to delivering these messages)
### Facilitators
Arm the facilitators with key topics, prep them to lead a micro “job-sim” of setting it up in the tool, brief maintenance thigns.
	This is important, this is expected, here’s what else might be helpful, here’s who to contact if you need help with (x,y,z).
