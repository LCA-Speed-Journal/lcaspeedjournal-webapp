# Example Slides: Job-Cost Master
Intro to explain the tool → Demo (Video to be gathered from VILT) 
→ Anticipating Key Function (where is “x”?) → Quick Reference Guide
# Needs
- Live-Training + Recording
- Put Recording in BAM
# Questions
Heather: How many reports?
	Over the next 1-2yrs, many more, but for PFW Launch, **6 Reports.**
Heather: How long per session?
	**30mins p/session**
Heather: Main Audience?
	Currently, Cognos report is mostly Ops, but some reports have more specific audience. Some groups are bigger, they’re currently in the process of drilling dow2n to identify key groups to focus in on with each session (so it can be a little smaller).
	**Sessions will vary depending on the training.**
Heather: are the reports restricted?
	Depending on the report, again
Heather: Who’s the trainer? 
	From Power BI Side, it’ll be Etna, Salusha, and Scott
Heather: Leader visibility?
	They’re aware, and have requested it (Brandon, for example)
Heather: when to start office hours?
	Hope to have the training done (live training) done sometime in Sept. 
	But, don’t need to be in Bridge until late-Oct. — Reccomendation is ASAP, but don’t want to rush it
# Current Idea
Office-Hours Solution: shorter-solution, hosted training sessions
	Q: Reaching out to Megan about comms plan? — Need to do this, don’t have an existing comms plan
Key-Note: Cognos Reports will have a depreciation date, will force people into PowerBI after a certain point.
	Still working on that day
## Key Objective
In September, will be releasing 4 reports alongside the PFW to train on.
- Job Cost Master & Job Cost Master Hours
	- (this is a new PBI report with two pages)
- PO Inquiry & PO Line Items by Job
	- (these are two pages added in the pre existing PBI report, PO/Subcontract Tracking Report)
- Hours Utilization
	- (this is a page added in the pre existing PBI report, PM Dashboard)
- PSR Total Job & PSR Sub Job Detail
	- (this is a new PBI Report with the ability to view the info at the job & sub job level
## Biggest Needs
- Comms Strategy: need to loop in Megan to get her POV and help on delivery
- Established Dates for Office Hours to populate in the tool
- Specifics: content details, slides, etc.
	- We’re here to help, but not needed for a template-following
