Opening it up → can of worms? Reports they don’t have access to?
	ID any security issues surrounding?
	Potential Solution: general principles + specifics for confidental reports
Point out (for training) → don’t know who’s using, as Cognos gives access to everything within a family
#### **Timeframe for Office-Hours:**
Most people are going to go after the recording, rather than the training, but want to offer the office-hours concept in-person for those who want to pursue that.
Sweet-spot tends to be 2-4, publish the best 1-2 courses into BAM
Need an initial kickoff email, pointing o9ut which reports are changing first, short and sweet — follow up with things like scheduling for training/office-hours, etc.
	End of Sept, early Oct? Further out than that is going to be an isssue
	**22nd is good date to start?**
	Trainings, aside from one, will be ready for each report.
PM Dash won’t go live until PFW, but certain components are totally ready to go. 
Putting all the reports into one PPT, repeat session 4 times?
	There’s different groups. But again, don’t want to train on individual reports.
Big Key-Idea: keep the training general, 
Only concern: getting the business to actually use the report, ened to have some kind of documentation out there (ofc)
Eph is probably the person to get ethe word out. But Brandon F. is aligned for sure.
##### Next-Steps
Need dates, who’s instructing, etc. We can create sessions, attend the sessions and record / upload after the fact, etc.
