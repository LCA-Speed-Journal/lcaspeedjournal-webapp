## Key Points: Q&A Section
#### What do I need to do before the first day of practice?
Register with the Athletic Office at the High School. You may need to have a physical (must be dated
after June 15, 2023). Contact the Athletic Office for specific information. (763) 745-6621 or visit
www.wayzataschools.org/athletics.
#### What do I need to bring to my first practice?
Running shoes, shorts, wristwatch, and t-shirt.
#### How long will practices last?
Usually we will be done with all meetings, stretching, strength work, and running within two hours of the
start of practice. There is a phone available for athletes to call for rides when practice is over.
#### What if I am out of town when practice begins?
You should contact Coach Popp and discuss any conflicts that would result in your missing practice.
#### How far will I be expected to run at the first practice?
If you are entering 7th, 8th, or 9th grade, there are no expectations. Whatever you can run will be fine. If
you are entering 10th to 12th grade, you are expected to run three miles or more without stopping.
#### Will athletes be “cut” from the team?
We have no limits in participation due to squad size. 
	If younger or new-to-Wayzata athletes attend practice regularly and abide by team policies, they “make” our team.
#### What is the attendance policy?
General Policy for Practice: Each runner is expected to attend all required practices or to have received prior approval for his absence from a coach.
	Acceptable Excuse: illness, illness/death in the family, out-of-town weddings or funerals, or running-related doctor appointments.
	Unexcused absences: Senior pictures, College visits, ACT/SAT practice tests or classes, ortho appointments, regular doctor exams, family vacations, birthday celebrations, etc. 
Poor or no communication regarding a normally acceptable miss may also result in an unexcused absence. Bottom line—there should be absolutely no question about where you are on any given day.
Grade Level Expectations: Recurring absences are a huge distraction to the team and coaching staff. As in all matters, coach’s discretion may also apply to attendance.
	Grades 10-12: no more than 3 unexcused absences may be accrued over the course of the season (with MEA being a JV exception).
	Grade 9: 9th graders get slightly more leeway. Multiple absences prior to the start of school count as one miss. Once school starts, however, 9 th graders are held to the same standard as the rest of the team. This gives families a chance to familiarize themselves with the program and the attendance policy.
Meet Expectations: Athletes are expected to be present at all competitions, whether they are competing or not. Missing / skipping a meet may result in dismissal from the team regardless of previous attendance records. Coach’s discretion may apply.
#### How are Varsity, Junior Varsity, Sophomore, Freshmen, and Middle School teams determined?
They aren’t. We typically have well north of 150 boys in the program. Prior to school starting, they will all
practice together at the High School. 
	Once school begins, 7th and 8th graders practice at Central MS, and 9-12th grade practices at the High School. 
**In practice, distinctions are made based on the fitness level and needs of each athlete.** 
At meets, the athlete’s **performance in practice and in previous competitions** determines in which race they will compete. 
	If they begin the year running in the JV race, they could still compete as a Varsity runner at the Section or State meet, or ones even sooner. 
XC race assignments are very fluid and flexible. The goal is to use the September and October meets to prepare athletes to compete well at the end of the season. 
	**Whoever is in good standing and gives our team the greatest chance** of success at the end of the year **will be a varsity athlete.**

#### Is this an intramural program or a running club?
Absolutely not. No. 
Our team mission is to be on the awards stand at the State Meet five years in a row. Individual goals are to become as fast as possible at racing one, two, or three miles. 
This is accomplished through **intense and consistent preparation**, and through a team atmosphere that stresses **effort and accountability.**
