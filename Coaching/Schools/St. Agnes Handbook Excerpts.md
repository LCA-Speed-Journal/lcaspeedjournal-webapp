# Junior-High Participation in High-School Athletics
Use of a 7th or 8th grade athlete on a high school team is discouraged whenever possible. 
However, if a coach at the high school level believes that there is an athlete in the 7th or 8th grade program who could participate on his/her team, they may appeal to the Athletic Director for the student to participate. 
Each case shall be handled individually. 
	2025 Stats: 19x MS Athletes on the Track & Field Team — 11x 8th (5x Boys, 6x Girls), 8x 7th (3x Boys, 5x Girls)
# Squad Selection: 
In accordance with our philosophy of athletics and our desire to see as many students as possible participate in athletic programs, we encourage coaches to keep as many students as they can without compromising the integrity of their sport. 
Time, space, facilities, equipment, and other factors will limit what is a reasonable squad size for any particular sport. 
# Cutting Policy (Varsity Only) 
Choosing the members of varsity teams is the sole responsibility of the coaches. 
Prior to trying out, the coach shall provide the following information to all candidates for the team: 
1. Time frame for try-out period 
2. Criteria used to select the team 
3. Practice commitment if they make the team 
4. Game commitments 
---
When a squad cut becomes a necessity, the process will include two important elements. 
Each candidate shall have: 
5. Competed in a minimum of 3 practice sessions. 
6. Been informed of the cut by the coach in person, including the reason. 
Coaches will discuss alternative possibilities for participation in the sport, or other areas in the activities program.
