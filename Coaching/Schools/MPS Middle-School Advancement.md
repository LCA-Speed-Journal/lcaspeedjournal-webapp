# Heading Statement
The MPS Athletics Department offers 34 high school programs for students in grades 7-12, and 6 middle school programs for students in grades 6-8.
## **Middle School Students Participating on High School Teams**
MPS allows middle school students who have the requisite interest, skills and abilities to try out for and in some cases join high school athletic teams.
All middle school athletes can seek the opportunity to “play up” at their designated community high school based on their home address or the middle school's pathway high school. 
	This is consistently applied even to current 8th graders who may have played up at a different school as 6th or 7th graders. 
### Middle to High School Pathways
- **Anthony Middle School's** pathway is Southwest High School

### Exceptions
