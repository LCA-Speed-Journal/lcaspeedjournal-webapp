# Definitions
SSC and Elastic Energy Generation
Neuro-Days — High-Intensity
General-Days — Tempo, etc.
## Quality
Strength-Prerequisite, Variable per Drill
## Technique
Posture, Spine, and Shin-Angles
- Bigger Deal than People Think
# Categories
- In-Place Jumps
- Short Bounds
- Extended Bounds
- Depth-Jumps
## In-Place Jumps
- Low-to-Medium Effort
- 150-300 Contacts p/session
	- Example — 8 Total-Sets of 20 Contacts p/set:
	- — 4x Bilateral Pogos (N-S-E-W)
	- — 2x Split-Stance Pogos
	- — 2x Alternating Split-Lunge
- use in General-Prep (1-2x p/wk)
	- 30s On, 30s off
## Short Bounds
- Low-to-Medium — 1-5 Contacts p/effort
- 30-60 Contacts p/session
- 1-2x p/wk in General Prep, 1x p/wk for rest of year
## Extended Bounds
- Medium-to-High (for Distance)
- 20-40m p/rep — 400m MAX Total-Volume
- 1x p/wk in SPP, 0x after
- Can be a tool to bridge the gap for 400m Guys
- Push for Vertical Emphasis Early
## Depth-Jumps
- Categorized by height, fairly High-Intensity
- 20-50 Contacts p/session (and know that 50 is…a lot)
	- SPP, Pre-Comp, and Comp-Phases
## Multi-Throws and Hurdle-Hops
- Stretch-Shortening, but Self-Governing
	- Keep Hurdle Heights Lower (~18”)
# General Technique for Multi-Jumps
- Foot Contacts — Full-Foot Contact
	- Cue — Rolling Contact
- Limb-Recoveries — Don’t Overcue This
- Trajectories — Overcue the Vertical Component
	- Outwards in initial, but also vertical
- Swing-Leg Radius
- Swing-Leg Symmetry
- Recovery Heights of the Free-Leg
	- Don’t need to cue the height
	- “Block with the Swing-Leg”
