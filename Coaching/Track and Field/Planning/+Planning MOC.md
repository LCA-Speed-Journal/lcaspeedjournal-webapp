Season planning documents, ideas, and organizational materials

- [[2024-25 Ideas]]: Planning document covering varsity/JV split (size cutoffs, practice timing, weekly split, North High partnership), coaching (staffing, volunteering), programming (warmups, drills, accel-focus, phases), and season reflections.
- [[2025-26 Ideas]]: Planning overview with embedded references to separate planning documents covering varsity/JV split, coaching thoughts, programming, meets, data-tracking, and media/socials.
- [[2025-26 Season]]: Season planning document for 2025-26 including goals (team firsts like girls 4x800m relay), conference/sections/state analysis, anticipated changes (new captains), and social media content plan with videos/reels and leaderboard posts.
- [[2025-Season Notes and Comments]]: Season reflections covering total headcount (coaches gaining momentum, athletes tightening growth), new practice elements (strength work as huge win, track work adjustments), team impact (stronger/more technical but flat outputs), positives and areas for improvement.
- [[2026 Ideas_Coaching]]: Coaching ideas for 2026 season focusing on creating more agency in event-groups (Ross: generalist/horizontal jumps, Peter: generalist/sprints, Jacque: vertical jumps/distance helper, Adam: throws) and parent volunteering for meet officiating.
- [[2026 Ideas_Data Tracking]]: Data tracking ideas for 2026 including metrics (more comp-specific, return to Big-3: jump high, jump far, sprint fast), frequency (need to up frequency, rotate through regularly), and buy-in strategies (compete more, rank/publish, incentivize outputs through multi-method rewards).
- [[2026 Ideas_Media and Socials]]: Social media content planning including single/carousel posts (meet day posts, key meets), reels (big events like speed trials, first lactic, highlights/team culture), and leaderboard posts (outputs per phase, weekly/bi-weekly achievers).
- [[2026 Ideas_Meets]]: Meet planning ideas covering scheduling (prioritize Gryphon Invites, SCPA on thin ice, potential swap for NLA/LILA), season timing (sprints: 200→100/400, distance: 400/1600→800/3200), and frequency guidelines (don't jump every meet, <2 running for first 2/3 of season).
- [[2026 Ideas_Programming]]: Programming ideas for 2026 including practices (warmups need variety, drills back off but refine, accel-focus sleds, need eccentric/decel work, accessories more consistency), phases (GPP wider base, lactic more frequency), and tech breakout details for hurdles, relays, throws, and jumps.
- [[2026 Ideas_V-JV Split]]: Varsity/JV split planning for 2026 including spring break practices (all together, 75mins), post-break (A-session 3:45-4:45, B-session 5:00-6:00), and track schedule (3x p/wk at North: M/W/F 5:00-6:15, weights/low-day 2x p/wk: T/Th A/B sessions).
- [[Structure and Seasonal Progression]]: Document outlining seasonal progression structure covering phases (onboarding, off-season high-low, pre-season superpowers/kryptonite, in-season high-low), movement prep, offseason programming, and in-season structure with high-low model and strength work integration.
- [[Training Organization for Groupings]]: [[Chris Korfist]] approach to organizing sprint groups including day 1 (film Fly-10's front/back/profile, stratify into tiers 1/2/3), day 2 (40m runs on 1080), and 3-group system (Pullers: limb-velocity, Pushers: ECC-RFD vertical + hamstring, Strikers: feet/hips focus) with specific training means for each.
