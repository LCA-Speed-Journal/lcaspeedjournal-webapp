# Thought: [[Student Media Partnership]]?
# Single / Carousel Posts
## Meet Day Posts:
The obvious, single-slide meet-day posts to mark each competition
## Key Meets: Season Opener, MCAA, etc.
Key meets will either be reels, or a carousel post highlighting important data (medals, records, etc)		
# Reels
#### Big Events: Speed Trials, First Lactic
Milestones, like the first practices, our first lactic day, etc.
	Also a campaign leading into the season.
### Highlights / Team-Culture
Big Components / Fun-Things we do.

## [[2025-26 Leaderboard-Posts|Leaderboards]]?
#### Outputs Per Phase?
Not sure how to package this, but feel like it could be valuable to post who's leading each metric.
#### Weekly / Bi-Weekly Achievers?
An opportunity to shout out the workhorses and those who fly under the radar, maybe?
