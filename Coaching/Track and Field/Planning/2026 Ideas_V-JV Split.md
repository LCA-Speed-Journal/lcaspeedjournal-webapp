# Varsity / JV Split
## Spring Break Practices
#### No Split: All-Together  — 75mins Total, Sprints only 60mins
1x Weights-Day, 2x Speed Days, 2x X-Factor Days. 
- Can blend strength-work into X-Factor.
- Distance runs 3x p/wk
	- 1 Speed, 1 X-Factor, alternating the other.
## Post-Break
#### A-Session: 3:45-4:45  — B-Session: 5:00-6:00(?)
Sticking with 1hr blocks like '25 season, was an appropriate amount of time without dragging on by end.
Shifting B-Session to leave 15min gap.
- Leaves more time for Q&A, 1-on-1 help following A, etc.
## Once It’s Warm Enough to Be at North
#### Track 3x p/wk: M, W, F — 5:00-6:15?
+15mins from '25 season, need a little more for tech-time. 
- Sprints will just cut early, or add accessories.
#### Weights/Low-Day 2x p/wk: T, Th – A/B
Low-Days like '25, good weekly flow. 
- A/B sessions worked well, balances equipment bandwidth.
#### Throws: Weights-Days become Tech
on STR Days: tech-time in A, weights in B. 
- More frequent drilling, still emphasizes strength-work.
#### Distance: Everyone Lumps into A
Lumping into A so that if/when it bleeds over into B, that's fine. 
- Gives more wiggle room for longer runs.
