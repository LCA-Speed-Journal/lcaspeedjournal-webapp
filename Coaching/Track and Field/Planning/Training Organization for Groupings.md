# Day 1
- Film Fly-10’s
	- Front and Back of the Athlete, in addition to the standard “in-profile”
	- Getting a starting point on mechanics
## Stratify Your Groups
Tiers 1, 2, and 3
- At HF, Korfist gets the top ~20
	- Practice separately, then act as Captains for the Others
## Looking at the Foot
- Side-Foot-Strike (Front, or Under)
- Heart/Head over Toes
	- Getting Heart out in Front — Mass in Front of The Engine
- Front — Crooked, or Straight
	- Foot under Ear, or Crossover-Gait
# Day-2
- 40m Runs on the 1080
	- Resistance on the Shoulders, no the Waist
# 3-Groups — Pullers, Pushers, and Strikers
## Pullers
Limb-Velocity (4.2Hz) — Leg-Swings, Overspeed (and overspeed mimicking)
- 10% vDec 30-40m Run
- Rotational Torso Work — to Failure
- Touch & Pulls, Pelvic Control, Cycles
- 40-50m from Blocks
- Strength-Work — Horizontal-Push will Transfer
## Pushers
ECC-RFD (Vertical) + Hamstring Follow-Through (once again [[Eccentric Forces and Athlete Profiling]])
- Bent-Leg Prime-Times
- Captain Morgans
- Banded Booms, Banded Switches, Marshalls
- Strength-Work — Straight-Leg Hamstring Pull-Throughs
## Strikers
Feet, Hips, and “about everything Else”
- Mini-Hurdles, Prime-Times
- Short MaxV Reps Vertical-Accel Sprints
- Lateral Sling — Elbows Locked Overhead (PVC Runs, Drills, etc.)
- Can-Cans, Switches to a Lateral Box
- Strength-Work — General Strength
# General Planning
- Balance Before Movement
	- Step 1 — Breathe
	- Step 2 — Horizon
## Bucket 1
Force/Power-Dominant in Workouts
- First 4-6wks — Just Acceleration
- Limiting Factor = Form-Under-Fatigue
	- Add End-of-Practice Torso Work — to Failure
## Bucket 2
Balancing Acceleration with Max-Velocity
- Ratio — Roughly 3 MaxV to 2 Accel
## Bucket 3
MaxV, Strength, and Speed-Endurance
# Weekly Planning
## Monday
- Tier 1 — 1080 Work
- Tier 2, 3 — Flys, Prime-Times, Line-Hops
## Tuesday
- Tier 1 — ISO-Foot and Torso / 400 Work
- Tier 2, 3 — Drills, Mini-Hurdles
## Wednesday
- Tier 1 — 2pt Accel
- Tier 2, 3 — OFF
## Thursday
- Tier 1 — OFF
- Tier 2, 3 — 23 Second Runs (Lactic)
## Friday
- Tier 1 — Blocks-Work
- Tier 2, 3 — Weights
# Specific Fixes
- Low-Force — Max-Effort Wall-Pushes
- Low-Power — Resisted Runs at Light-Medium Load (50% vDec at Most)
