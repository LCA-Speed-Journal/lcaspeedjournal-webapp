**Meet Description:** pulling the top marks across the state of MN, all divisions, into the same meet, in the early-to-mid season, before conference meets start occuring.
**Qualification:** the Hamline Elite doesn’t qualify precisely on standard, but rather just allows coaches to submit any athlete for qualification review, and the select the best (x) athletes (the cutoff is determined per event). However, using these “last in” marks, we can gather an idea for what a qualifying mark might be.
