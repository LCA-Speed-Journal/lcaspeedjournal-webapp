## Note on Benchmark Adjustments

Some benchmarks in this document have been adjusted based on real athlete data from the 2024-2025 seasons. Adjusted values are marked with an asterisk (*). The adjustments use a weighted average of theoretical and empirical data, with weights based on sample size (n=1 → 20% weight, n≥5 → 100% weight).

For details on the adjustment methodology and full comparison data, see `benchmark_validation_report.txt` and `benchmark_comparison.csv` in the LCA-Speed-Journal project directory.

# Practice Metrics Performance Levels

This document translates track & field event performance standards into practice metric standards across 8 levels of competition. This analysis helps gauge where athletes are at in their key practice metrics (Max Velocity, X-Factor, Lactic) and understand the performance thresholds needed to be competitive at each level in actual competition.

## Competition Level Hierarchy
1. **Hamline Elite** - Elite state-wide meet pulling top marks across all divisions (Average Qualifying Mark since 2014)
2. **Class A State Qualifying** - State championship qualifying standard
3. **Section Standout** - Intermediate standard between State and Sectional qualifying (calculated as midpoint)
4. **Sectional Qualifying (4A)** - Sectional championship qualifying standard  
5. **MCAA Conference Podium (5th Place)** - Conference-level podium threshold (Average of 2023-2025)
6. **Varsity Avg** - Varsity-level average standard (1/3 of the gap from Conference to MS Qualification)
7. **JV Avg** - JV-level average standard (2/3 of the gap from Conference to MS Qualification)
8. **Middle School → JV/Varsity Qualification** - Entry-level standard for MS athletes (using "Existing T&F/XC Performance" standards)

  - JV Avg: Calculated as 2/3 of the gap from Conference to MS Qualification (Conference + 2*(MS - Conference) / 3)
  - MS Qualification: "Existing T&F/XC Performance" standards from `Shakopee T&F_Middle-School Qualification.md`
- **Reference Performance Charts**: `Reddit Sprint Charts.md` provides performance benchmarks at various sprint performance levels
  - Used as source data for men's Max-Velocity (from flying sprint m/s values), 30m Block Start, Vertical Jump, and Standing Broad Jump standards
  - 30m Block Start mapped to our performance levels based on 100m sprint time alignments
  - Max-Velocity, Vertical Jump, and Standing Broad Jump mapped to our performance levels based on 200m time alignments
  - Provides more realistic practice metric values than conversion from event performances

## Conversion Formulas

### Max Velocity
- **Max Velocity (Boys)**: Derived from `Reddit Sprint Charts.md` flying sprint m/s values
  - Flying sprint m/s values converted to mph using: mph = m/s × 2.237
  - Reddit chart provides m/s values for flying sprints (Flying 10m, 20m, 25m, 30m) at 8 performance levels
  - Mapped to our performance levels based on 200m time alignments
- **Max Velocity (Girls)**: Derived directly from 100m performance standards using Tony Holler - [Translating MPH Into Track Times](https://trackfootballconsortium.com/translating-mph-into-track-times/)
  - Direct mph relationships for 100m times:
  - 12.50s → 19.4 mph, 12.65s → 19.1 mph, 12.81s → 18.7 mph, 13.00s → 18.3 mph
  - 13.65s → 16.9 mph, 13.66s → 16.8 mph, 14.53s → 14.9 mph, 15.40s → 13.0 mph
  - Linear interpolation/extrapolation between known data points
  - Note: State level (19.1 mph) is slightly higher than Elite (18.7 mph) because State 100m time (12.65s) is faster than Elite (12.81s)
- **Note**: Max velocity represents the ceiling - athletes must be CAPABLE of maintaining this speed, but actual 200m performance depends on speed endurance

### Acceleration: 30m Block
- **30m Block Start (Boys)**: Derived from `Reddit Sprint Charts.md` 30m Block Start values
  - Reddit chart provides 30m Block Start times at 8 performance levels (columns 1-8)
  - Mapped to our performance levels based on 100m sprint time alignments
  - Column mapping: Elite/State (11.22-11.23s 100m) → Column 7 (4.14s), Sectional/Conference (11.82-11.83s 100m) → Column 5 (4.34s), JV Entry (12.52s 100m) → Column 3 (4.54s), MS Qualification (13.2s 100m) → Column 1 (4.74s)
- **30m Block Start (Girls)**: Derived from `Reddit Sprint Charts.md` 30m Block Start values
  - Mapped to our performance levels based on 100m sprint time alignments
  - Column mapping: Elite (12.81s 100m) → Column 2 (4.64s), State (12.65s 100m) → Column 3 (4.54s), Sectional/Conference (13.65-13.66s 100m) → Column 1 (4.74s)
  - JV Entry (14.53s 100m) and MS Qualification (15.4s 100m) values extrapolated from Column 1 reference (5.04s and 5.34s respectively)
- **Note**: 30m Block Start measures acceleration capability from a block start, indicating explosive acceleration potential

### X-Factor Metrics
- **Vertical Jump (Boys)**: Derived from `Reddit Sprint Charts.md` performance benchmarks
  - Represents distance from standing reach (vertical jump test measurement)
  - Mapped to performance levels based on 200m times
  - **Vertical Jump (Girls)**: Recalculated using men's decrement pattern
    - Starting point: men's Column 5 level (~23.4" / 1' 11.5") from Reddit Sprint Charts
    - Applied men's average decrement pattern (12.84% per level) to calculate subsequent levels
    - More realistic practice metric values than previous conversion from High Jump clearance
- **Standing Broad Jump (Boys)**: Derived from `Reddit Sprint Charts.md` performance benchmarks
  - More realistic values for practice metrics than conversion from Long Jump
  - Mapped to performance levels based on 200m times
  - **Standing Broad Jump (Girls)**: Recalculated using men's decrement pattern
  - Starting point: men's Column 6 level (~110.2" / 9' 2.25") from Reddit Sprint Charts
  - Applied men's average decrement pattern (6.29% per level) to calculate subsequent levels
  - More realistic practice metric values than previous conversion from Long Jump distance
- **Standing Triple Jump**: 0.45 × Triple Jump distance (research-based ratio)
  - Accounts for run-up and technique advantages in Triple Jump
- **Note**: Boys' standards (Max-Velocity, Vertical Jump, Standing Broad Jump) are derived from Reddit Sprint Charts. Girls' standards are recalculated using men's decrement pattern with proportional starting points from men's chart levels. This provides more realistic practice metric values than previous conversion ratios, which were approximate and varied based on individual athlete characteristics and technique development

### Lactic Metrics
- **24/28s Drill**: distance (m) = (24 or 28 / target_200m_time) × 200m
  - Calculates distance covered in 24 seconds (boys) or 28 seconds (girls) at the target 200m pace
  - Also known as "23 Second Drill" in Feed the Cats methodology
- **3x200m Prediction**: Directly uses 400m event standards as predicted times
  - Based on relationship: 400m ≈ (200m×2)+4s for boys, (200m×2)+5s for girls (Tony Holler)
  - 3x200m test accounts for fatigue in the prediction, so 400m standards are used directly
- **Kosmin 800m Test**: Works backwards from 800m event standards using standard Kosmin formulas
  - Test protocol: 2 x 60s maximal efforts with 3min rest between, measuring total distance covered
  - **Boys**: Distance (m) = (217.77778 - Time_seconds) / 0.119556
  - **Girls**: Distance (m) = e^((1451.46 - Time_seconds) / 198.54)
    - Note: Standard formula uses natural logarithm (ln) as base-10 logarithm produces unrealistic values
  - Formulas derived from standard Kosmin test research (runbundle.com, sportresources.blogspot.com)
- **Kosmin 1600m Test**: Works backwards from 1600m event standards using 1500m Kosmin formula
  - Test protocol: 4 x 60s maximal efforts with decreasing rest periods (3min, 2min, 1min), measuring total distance covered
  - Also known as "Kosmin 1500m Test" (translated to mile/1600m)
  - **Boys**: Distance (m) = (500.52609 - Time_seconds) / 0.162174
  - **Girls**: Distance (m) = (510.52609 - Time_seconds) / 0.162174
  - Formulas derived from standard Kosmin test research (runbundle.com, sportresources.blogspot.com)
- **Note**: 3200m Kosmin test standards are not included in this analysis

## Calculations

- **Time formats**: All times converted to seconds for calculations, displayed in original format (SS.ms or MM:SS.ms)
- **Distance formats**: Maintained in feet'inches" format for readability, rounded to nearest quarter-inch
- **Gap percentages**: Calculated as ((Level 2 - Level 1) / Level 1) × 100 (negative indicates lower/faster for speed/distance metrics, positive indicates slower for time metrics)

## Notes

- Practice metric standards are derived by working backwards from event performance standards using established conversion relationships
- These standards represent targets for practice metrics that correlate with competitive event performance levels
- Individual athlete results may vary from these standards based on technique, training history, and event specialization
- Max-velocity measurements should use the highest velocity achieved from any split metric in practice (30-40m split, 40-50m split, etc.)
- X-Factor metrics are measured without run-up (standing/vertical jump tests)
- Lactic metrics are performed at best effort with appropriate rest protocols
- These standards provide benchmarks for tracking athlete development across the key practice metric categories
