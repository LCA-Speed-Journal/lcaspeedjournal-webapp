# Meets
## Scheduling
#### Gryphon Invites: Prioritize Again
- The bread and butter of 25, also our main course for '26. 
- Always run well, consistent location too. Good.	
#### Go for Good-Vibes: SCPA on Thin Ice
- Prep-Relays was a Mess, and got left off of the Prep-Invitational. 
- Potentially swap for NLA/LILA Meet.	
## Season Timing
Sprints: 200 → 100/400
- General thoughts, can vary. 
- Starting in the middle, branching to more extreme as time goes on
Distance: 400/1600 → 800/3200
- Same idea as sprints, starting in the middle/foundation and then branching out to the more extreme.	
## Frequency
Don't Jump Every Meet
- Did decent in '25, need to balance so multi-jumpers get enough practice by championship season.	
<2 Running for First 2/3 of Season
- Good balance in '25. 
- Keep this frequency, it seemed to work fairly well.
