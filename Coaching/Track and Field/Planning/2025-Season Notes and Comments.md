# Total Headcount
## Coaches: Gaining some Positive Momentum
**Peter** upping participation from '24 to being almost full-time coach, huge help across the board.
**Jacque** coming on board to help with bigger days and meet volunteering. Bonus hands? Big.	
## Athletes: Tightening up 2024’s Growth
2024 we gained a lot of mass. 
2025 we focused on bringing up the overall quality of said mass. 
2026 will likely be a hybrid, continuing to develop while also recruiting newer faces.			
### Girls: Built More Interest, Buy-In
Gathered more interest in the upper-school through positive culture, Eloise rallying middle.
Strength work inspired a few lowerclassmen, hopefully pull some confidence out in '26 and on.				
### Boys: Built lots of Momentum and Rising-Talent
Building novices into intermediates, rising sophomores will carry talent-pool into 2025-26. 
Strength caught eyes, could be a positive recruitment tactic if it continues to be a theme.

# New Practice Elements
## General Thoughts: Great Ideas, but Need Balance
Both increased strength-work and leveraging North St. Paul's track were big wins. 
That being said, we need to work on balancing around these added elements, they produced unique challenges.				
## Strength Work: **Huge** Win this Season
We were getting comments from athletes, parents, staff, other coaches: **strength-days worked.** 
Working 2x p/wk gave good contrast as "low-days," while also allowing us to build basic strength.
#### Need to Adjust Periodization in 2026
- The 1x20 series worked great for beginners, but took too long to get to more standard lifting. 
- Need to adjust the pacing so that we reach 1x10 sooner
	- that way we can work power more mid-to-late.
## Track Work: Great Resource, but a Tough Adjustment
Having a track was the single biggest win this year. Drill sprint reps in spikes, train jumpers with an actual pit, all helped massively. 
	However, spent too much time on tech, not enough on outputs.
#### Frequency was Too Low, Tough to Plan. 
Twice p/wk was a good start, but made it difficult to prioritize. 
- If we can push this out to 3x p/wk in 2026, it might give better flexibility for balancing tech, outputs, and lactic.

# Team Impact
## General Thoughts: Stronger, More Technical. But Flat.
Strength work and tech both improved a lot, so our kids looked better and were more efficient. 
	However, outputs fell off, so we started lacking pop and aggression by the important meets.
## Positives
#### Massive Strength Gains. Noticeably Bigger
Kids were getting noticeably bigger / more muscular over the season, strength numbers kept going up, and >75% of kids looked forward to the weights days. 
	**Big for culture, big for results.**				
#### Started Dialing in some Tech
Focusing tech on 85% of our track-days really did help our kids learn to "look better" doing their event. 
We had a breakout year for triple, largely attributed to how much drilling we prioritized.				
#### Team Culture underwent Massive Growth
Team felt a lot closer within event groups. 
	Distance always running together, sprints together, lifting as a team — all brought us together, which led to a great atmosphere at competitions.				
## Negatives
#### Outputs fell Off-The-Map in the Late-Season
We started to overprioritize tech, so outputs flattened. We needed to continue keeping them in the rotation, not putitng the cart before the horse. 
	**Raw outputs beat tech 9/10 times.**				
#### Measurements only used in the Early-to-Mid Season
Along with the above, we stopped measuring key things. Putting data-collection on a pedestal makes kids chase PR's in practice, which drives results. 
	**Need to light that fire again.**				
#### Lost a lot of our inter-athlete Competition
SInce we stopped measuring, kids stopped competing with one another unless they were lined up side-by-side. Again, competition drives effort, which drives results. 
	**Motivate / Encourage.**

# Structure
## General Thoughts: Great Ideas, but Lost Structure
Split sessions were a huge help in managing coach bandwidth, let us focus a lot better. 
	Did end up confusing some, got rough with the distance-group, and tech breakouts.
## Positives
#### Split-Sessions
Having half the amount in each group meant we could watch a lot more closely, and could cater our drills a little more specifically to experience level. 
This was **definitely the right move.**
#### Tech-Time was more Focused
## Negatives
#### A/B for Sprinters: Didn’t always Work
When distance went to run, and particularly mid-to-late season when people were missing for academics / events, our A-Group was tentative at best. 
	Might get better with total team-growth.				
#### Distance: a Bit of Confusion
Having distance split for weights-days, but together for runs, confused a lot of them. 
Next year, likely looking to bunch them into one giant pack, and work around it.				
#### Tech-Breakouts at Track: Awkward
Need to just start bringing everyone to the track, splitting was just awkward. 
Our tech-groups were too small, need a little more numbers to make it work. Might improve with growth.

# Team Composition
## Whole Team: Biggest Gaps in Hurdles, Mid-to-Long Dist
Only 3 hurdlers, and Sophia was stretched to all events. 
	Need a few dedicated individuals for both the 100mH and the 300mH, it was consistently where we couldn't measure up at meets/practice.				
Started having a full distance group, but losing 2 seniors, so will need to develop talent. 
400m was not as strong, typically a stretch up for sprints or down for distance. 
	Need dedicated crew.				
## Girls: Gaps in…everything. 
**Mostly Distance, but also Relays. Just Hurting for Bodies.**
Eloise being our only distance athlete was really rough. 
	She tried her best, but with how small our overall numbers were, it couldn't go as far as it could've with say, 4-6 more girls.				
Not having enough women to fill out relays was the biggest pain-point, both for points and for morale. 
	Need to recruit more, it's a gigantic hole in our total women's participation.				
## Boys: Biggest Gaps in Hurdles, Mid-Dist
Evan as the only hurdler was a tall order, considering it was his first year. 
	Need to push for new bodies filtering in here: the 300mH is easier to fill than the 100mH, but should push regardless.				
Mid-Distance was also a gap for us. 
	Had some strong milers, some strong 100m guys, but that 200/400 range bit us in quite a few meets as far as team-bandwidth, particularly 4x2 and 4x4.
