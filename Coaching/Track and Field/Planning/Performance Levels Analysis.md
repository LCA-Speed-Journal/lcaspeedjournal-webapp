# Performance Levels Analysis

This document synthesizes track & field performance standards across 8 levels of competition, ordered from most competitive to least competitive. This anal2y1sis helps gauge where athletes are at in their individual events and understand the performance thresholds needed to be competitive at each level.
## Competition Level Hierarchy
1. **Hamline Elite** - Elite state-wide meet pulling top marks across all divisions (Average Qualifying Mark since 2014)
2. **Class A State Qualifying** - State championship qualifying standard
3. **Section Standout** - Intermediate standard between State and Sectional qualifying (calculated as midpoint)
4. **Sectional Qualifying (4A)** - Sectional championship qualifying standard  
5. **MCAA Conference Podium (5th Place)** - Conference-level podium threshold (Average of 2023-2025)
6. **Varsity Avg** - Varsity-level average standard (1/3 of the gap from Conference to MS Qualification)
7. **JV Avg** - JV-level average standard (2/3 of the gap from Conference to MS Qualification)
8. **Middle School → JV/Varsity Qualification** - Entry-level standard for MS athletes (using "Existing T&F/XC Performance" standards)

# Key Insights

## Overall Performance Level Differences
1. **Elite to State**: Very small gaps (0-2%), indicating State qualifiers are near-elite level performers
2. **State to Section Standout**: Moderate gaps (2-6% for time events, 4-14% for field events), representing a meaningful step down from State qualifying standards
3. **Section Standout to Sectional**: Moderate gaps (3-6% for time events, 5-19% for field events), completing the transition from State to Sectional level
4. **Sectional to Conference**: Generally small to moderate gaps (0-6%), with some events showing Conference being slightly faster (likely due to conference competitiveness variations)
5. **Conference to Varsity Avg**: Moderate gaps (4-9% for time events, 3-8% for field events), representing the transition from competitive conference-level performance to varsity-level average performance
6. **Varsity Avg to JV Avg**: Moderate gaps (4-8% for time events, 3-8% for field events), representing the transition from varsity-level average to JV-level average performance
7. **JV Avg to MS Qualification**: Moderate gaps (4-8% for time events, 3-14% for field events), representing the transition from JV-level average to middle school qualification standards
## Event-Specific Observations
### Sprint Events
- The gap from Conference to MS Qualification is substantial (11-36% slower), broken into three stages (Conference → Varsity Avg → JV Avg → MS)
- Elite and State standards are very close, showing elite state-wide competition
- The State to Sectional gap is split into two more manageable stages (State → Section Standout → Sectional), with gaps of 2-4% for most sprint events
- 400m shows the largest percentage gaps between levels
- The split between Conference → Varsity Avg → JV Avg → MS is balanced for most sprint events, with each gap representing approximately 1/3 of the total Conference to MS gap
### Distance Events  
- Gaps increase with distance (800m < 1600m < 3200m)
- Conference standards sometimes exceed Sectional (likely due to strong conference competition)
- The Conference → Varsity Avg → JV Avg → MS gaps are balanced for distance events, with each gap representing approximately 1/3 of the total Conference to MS gap
### Hurdles
- The large gap between State and Sectional (12-23% slower) is now split into two stages (State → Section Standout → Sectional), with gaps of 6-12% at each stage
- Conference and Sectional are relatively close
- Conference → Varsity Avg → JV Avg → MS gaps show moderate and balanced progression (approximately 6-8% slower per stage)
### Field Events
- Shotput and Discus show the largest absolute gaps
- High Jump and Long Jump gaps are more modest
- Field event gaps are balanced across Conference → Varsity Avg → JV Avg → MS, with each gap representing approximately 1/3 of the total Conference to MS gap

# Data Sources and Methodology

## Sources
- **Hamline Elite**: Average Qualifying Mark (compiled average since 2014) from `Hamline-Elite Qualifying Standards.md`
- **Class A State**: Standards from `2024-2025 Class A State-Qualifying Standards.md`
- **Sectional 4A**: Standards from `2024-25 Sectional Qualifying Standards in 4A.md`
- **MCAA Conference**: Average of 2023-2025 5th place marks from `MCAA Conference Podium Standards.md`
- **Varsity Avg**: Calculated as 1/3 of the gap from Conference to MS Qualification (Conference + (MS - Conference) / 3)
- **JV Avg**: Calculated as 2/3 of the gap from Conference to MS Qualification (Conference + 2*(MS - Conference) / 3)
- **MS Qualification**: "Existing T&F/XC Performance" standards from `Shakopee T&F_Middle-School Qualification.md` (with estimates for missing events, marked with asterisks)
## Calculations
- **Time formats**: All times converted to seconds for calculations, displayed in original format (SS.ms or MM:SS.ms)
- **Distance formats**: Maintained in feet'inches" format for readability, rounded to nearest inch or quarter-inch
- **MCAA Conference averages**: Calculated as mean of 2023, 2024, and 2025 5th place marks
- **Gap percentages**: Calculated as ((Level 2 - Level 1) / Level 1) × 100 for time events (negative indicates faster)
## Notes
- Sectional standards do not include relay events
- MCAA Conference standards are for 5th place (podium threshold), not qualifying
- Section Standout standards are calculated as the mathematical midpoint between State and Sectional qualifying standards
- Varsity Avg and JV Avg standards split the gap from Conference to MS Qualification into three equal parts, providing more granular performance level distinctions
- MS qualification uses different equipment weights for some events (noted in parentheses)
- Estimated MS qualification standards (marked with *italics*) were calculated using average percentage decreases from Conference to MS for events with actual data
- All events now have MS qualification standards (some estimated based on patterns from events with actual data)
