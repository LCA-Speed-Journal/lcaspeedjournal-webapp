# Varsity / JV Split
(see also: [[2024-25 JV/V Outline and Plan]])
## Varsity: Size-Cutoff
Mainly Sprints, Semi-Throws?
- Sprints: <8 p/gender; Throws: ?? — No cut on Distance || (Sprints: Room for 2 Boys, 5 Girls)
## Practice: Timing
Split-Halves to Practices
- First 45: JV-Focus
- Back 45: V-Focus
- Last 15 of JV: Varsity Warmup (Captain-Led)
## Weekly Split?
- M/Th: All-Athletes
- JV Only Day?
- V Only Day?
## Special: North High Partnership
During V’s usual time-slot (5:00-6:00pm)
- Sprints: Curve-Runs, Blocks, Lactic, Handoffs
- Jumps: Approaches (short and full), Pop-Ups, Landings
- Throws: Full-Throws
# Coaching
## Staffing
Sprints / Jumps / Throws-Oriented: Need headcount for tech-breakouts				
Can train novices, but prefer *some* background				
Not needed on all days. However, looking for 2-3x p/wk.
## Volunteering
Can be Parents: helping out at Meets with Event-Officiating
+Come out for bigger practices (Lactic, Mock-Meets, etc)
# Programming
## Practices
Warmups: More Variety
- Movement Exploration went well, but need more novel things (maintain play). 
- ADD MUSIC/RHYTHM
Drills: More Volume
- Integrate more Extensive-Plyos, Constraints, and Skill-Work (e.g. Wickets)				
Accel-Focus to Early-Season: Sleds
- ≥1x p/wk, progress by decreasing load. 
- PWR → Sp. STR → Tech Competency
	- 50% → 25% → 10% vDec
## Phases
GPP: Take a Little Longer
- Can take a little longer for general athleticism: no need to rush the sprinting/jumping				
Lactic: Well-Timed
- Wait until the end of the prep-phase again, worked well and didn't overwhelm				
## Tech Breakout
Jumps: Need WAY More Base
- Don't worry about full-approaches, but need more short-approach volume. 
- Good Components: Toe-Toe-Toe—Flat-Flat Drill; S-S-S—L-S Drill				
Relays: Need More Trade-Off
- Too much handoffs for little pay-off
- work in some more sprint-specific work (wicket, sled)				
Hurdles: Need Recruits
- Go hunting in JV: make everyone do hurdle-mobility, see who excels → force the 300mH.				
Throws: More Throwing Time
- Throws overall need more quality reps + drills				
Vertical Jumps
- Need some kind of individualized help, didn't get a lot of focus in '24 Season				
# Meets
## Scheduling
Gryphon Invites: Prioritize Series
- Snagged all these for 2025: V and JV. 
- Let kids get comfy here, play around, make friends				
SCL Invite: Goodbye, Trash
- Not playing the bad-meet game again. Plus we get crushed. So...not worth it to me.				
## Season Timing
General Theme: Short to Long
- More important for the advanced, less important for the novices, but don't go nuts				
## Frequency
Don't Jump Every Meet
- This fried our jumpers. Don't need to hammer every time, it's a lot of stress. Do other events too.	
<2 Running for First 2/3 of Season						
# Tracking
## Metrics
More Comp-Specific Metrics						
Slightly more Diversity
- Speed wasn't as arousing at end of prep-phase; need other more motivating things
	- Speed Games?				
## Buy-In
Leaderboard Changes
- Publicize Better, but also Convert to more Understandable Units (mph, infographics)
# Ideas and Concepts
## Scorecards/Evals
"Experts and Other Coaches: 
Practice Observation and Ranking"
- Likert Scale (1-10?), (#) categories. Free Response if desired. Debrief with each expert.
	- Re-Test later: same metrics, focusing on better/worse/same. 				
Captains						
Athletes: Voting for Drills/Games? 
- Gives a sense of contribution, but still constrained to practice				

## Progress Reports
JV Athletes: Fundamentals	
Varsity Athletes: Sport-Specific
