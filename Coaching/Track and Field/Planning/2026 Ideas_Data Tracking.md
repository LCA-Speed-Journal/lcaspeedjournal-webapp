# Data-Tracking
## Metrics
#### More Comp-Specific Metrics:
Relate primary metrics to events to establish better buy-in. 
- Sprinting, Jumping, Throwing.				
#### Return to The Well. 
Hammer **The Big-3**.
- Jump High: Standing / Approach
- Jump Far: Broad / Bound Variants
- Sprint Fast: Accels / Flys
## Frequency
#### Need to Up our Frequency This Year.
2024-25 shared a theme: got off to a good start, but measuring fell off by mid-season (a pattern). 
- Need to keep regular touchpoints.	
#### Rotate through, work in regularly
Doesn't have to be a big deal 
	(e.g. grab verticals at beginning of practice, a box-broad within weights day)	
## Buy-In
#### Compete more. Rank, Publish. 
(see [[Web-App for Time-Comparisons]])
Lost sense of competition, distance/throws were in their own world. 
- General athleticism? Compete all.	
#### Incentivize Outputs: Multi-Method
- Reward performance thresholds
	- (22mph, 30" vertical, etc)
- Also recognize relative PR's
	- (3%, 5%, etc)
