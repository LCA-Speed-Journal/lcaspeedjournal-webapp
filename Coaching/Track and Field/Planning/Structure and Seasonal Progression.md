# Phases
- Onboarding — Preparation, Slowing-Down
- Off-Season — [[High-Low Model]] of Programming
- Pre-Season — Superpowers and Kryptonite Programming (as [[Hunter Eisenhower]])
- In-Season — High-Low Model (again)
## Movement Prep
- Raise Mood, while also Screening Warmups
- Multi-planar warmups
- Quality over Duration
## Offseason
- High-Day — Sprint, Jump, Strength
- Low-Day — Tendons and Tissues
- Sprint-Focuses
	- First 4-Steps
	- Good Progressive Body-Rise
- Lift → GPP → SPP
	- 1x20, 1x14 / 1x8, 8x5, 10x4
## In-Season
- High-Low, or Prep-High-Low-Prep-High
- STR — Simple, Focus on the Contraction
	- Contrast with Jumps
	- Can also use as a Competition-Primer
