## Practices
#### Warmups: Started to become Routine
Starting leaning too heavily on same drills by mid-to-late season. 
- Need to keep it "alive" whole-way-thru.	
Would like to update some of these pieces – see [[2026 Warmup Ideas]].

> [!NOTE] Distance Caveat
Can **extend the warmup** on track-days (place extension where A-Group usually is on other days) for additional weekly mileage.

#### Drills: back off a touch, but refine
We hammered the same core set a little too hard. 
- Need to back off, but stick in similar "drill-family."
- Start incorporating variations! PVC-Overhead, Med-Ball, etc. Lots of ways to keep things “alive.”
#### Accel-Focus to Early-Season: Sleds	
≥1x p/wk, progress by decreasing load. 
- PWR → Sp. STR → Tech Competency — 50% → 25% → 10% vDec
- See [[Separating Groups by Deficiency]] for more guidelines from Les Spellman on this
#### Need to include more Eccentric / Deceleration Work
Improves our ability to handle braking forces, which helps at top-speeds.
	Don’t usually focus, since we’re accel/MaxV dominant, with minimal focused decel-work.
	Might be hurting us at top-speed by proxy, ironically enough.
#### Accessories: More Consistency
Get a little during weights, but follow the High-Low model and throw some on Speed/X-Factor
	No issues with 
## Phases
#### GPP: Wider Base of Movement
Didn't do as much tumbling/movement-exploration past pre-season/early-prep. 
- Need to integrate more.	
#### Lactic: Need More Frequency
Pushing for a 200m-Focus this season
- Need to use Lactic 1x p/wk in [[Preparation Phase]], and more in [[Competition Phase]].
## Tech Breakout
#### H. Jumps: Consistent Tech, Don't Forget about the Outputs though.
Outputs fell off in '25 season, lost a lot of pop by late-meets. Need to keep doing outputs and tech.
- Good Components:
	- Toe-Toe-Toe—Flat-Flat Drill
	- S-S-S—L-S Drill
	- 4" box as board
	- 4" box on 3rd / last				
#### Relays: Gotta carve out more time
Overcorrected from 24→25, stopped doing as many handoffs. 
- Need to re-incorporate.				
#### Hurdles: Still Need Recruits
Losing Sophia means down for women. 
- Train up Evan, recruit another boy or two, pull in girls as we can.	
#### Throws: Rebalance for Multis
25 leaned a bit too hard on tech-time
- Secondary events didn't get as much attention (i.e Sprint-Outputs)	
#### V. Jumps: Need to Invest More
Started getting a bit more help in '25, but need to work more in '26 as we get fresh faces.
