# How to Cut-Step in the Hurdles
Definition: transfer of vertical force into horizontal momentum
- Striking with Ball-of-Foot — not striking with the heel
- Landing under the Hip — not out in front
- Need to Set Up Well into the First Hurdle — Strong Acceleration
	- Not enough momentum will cause the athlete to reach
	- Poor momentum over Hurdle 1 means playing catch-up
- Hard to just “Do It” — need to practice over time to understand
	- Break down the cues — strike ball-of foot, strike under hip, cast low, etc.
