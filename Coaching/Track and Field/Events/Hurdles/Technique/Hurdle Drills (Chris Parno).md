## Drills — What, When, Why?
### Two General Philosophies to Hurdle-Coaching
- **Philosophy A: No Drilling** — full hurdling is the best way to learn hurdling
	- Rationale — It’s the most specific
	- [[Alec Holler]] leans towards this camp, though uses some component drills for form
- **Philosophy B: Part-Practice** — working specific elements of the hurdle events individually (drills)
### Toolbox
- General Arsenal — strengthening, positioning, technical
- Specialized Drills — problem solving, issue-driven
### Equipment:
- Shortened Hurdles
- Wickets
- PVC
- Scissor-Hurdles
## Example Warmup
- Static Drills
	- Static Lead Legs (don’t touch the hurdle)
	- Wall Drill (Lead-Leg)
	- Knee to Trail Shots
	- Trail Slides
	- Trail Circles (hold at 12:00)
	- Falling-Over-Hurdle Cycles
- Dynamic Drills
	- 1-Step Leads
	- 1-Step Trails
	- 3-Step Quick-Drills (12-18 Steps)
	- Mini Hurdles (quick/rhythm)
	- Hurdle Box-Drill (flip the hurdles)
## Static Drills
- **Seated Lead-Lifts** — in hurdle-stretch on ground, lifting front leg to strengthen flexors
	- Keep toes pulled up
	- Regression is to lean back to make it easier, Progression is to be upright to make harder
	- 2x10, 3x10, etc. per each side
- **Seated Trail-Lifts** — general mobility in hurdle-stretch, externally rotating hip up (glute-med)
- **Seated Dynamic Lean with Arm** — leaning forward over lead, punching arm through
- **Static Lead-Leg** — standing between two hurdles
	- Hands braced on back, lifting knee up and extend ankle over top of front hurdle
	- 2x10, 3x10 p/leg
- **Trail-Slides** — standing against front hurdle, trail resting on perpendicular hurdle behind
	- Knee to Elbow, not to Armpit
	- Perpendicular Hurdle — front edge slightly ahead of the hips
- **Trail Slide-Offs** — as Trail Slide, but sliding up through elbow, 
	- pausing at 12:00, then striking down and back
- **Trail-Overs** — same as Slide-Offs, but no perpendicular hurdle, it’s parallel now
	- Similar path, working on keeping heel tight, hips level, but big ROM
- **Fall-Overs** — step over the top, lean forward, grab hurdle ahead, then as Trail-Over
- **Wall-Leads** — need to project hips, feeling them travel *past* the foot
	- Not just a walk-up and tap
	- Mark out where the athlete should takeoff from so they have a visual guide (~3ft off wall)
	- Great beginner drill, can progress to add a cut step before the projection
- **Wall-Trails** — hands on wall, forward lean, hurdles even with the hip
	- Reach leg out and back, slow sweep of the trail leg through (pulling to armpit)
	- Again, pausing at peak flexion
	- Can progress to add a light band around the ankle to help athlete strengthen the pull
### In-Place / Walking Drills
*Dynamic/Techincal movement without speed/rhythm*
- **Trail-Chase** (Active-Trail) — Hold Lead-Leg over the hurdle, hop and pull trail through
	- Make sure hurdle-height is low for this (bottom notch or PVC Hurdle)
- **Walking Lead Leg** — 2 feet between hurdles (between crossbar and legs of next)
	- Can add Skipping
- **Walking Trail Leg** — same spacing as walking lead
	- Stepping the lead-leg in line with the crossbar
- **Walking Over the Top** — Walkovers, putting the walking lead + trail together
	- Reaching out, “checking watch,” then coming down and around (punch thru)
- Cut-Step Drills:
	- **Wall Drill** — start further back, work a small cycle into the cut, then project
	- **Wall-Attacks** — no hurdle, cutting sharp then projecting forward w/knee (as the [[Yuri]])
	- **Repeated Cut-Steps** — Ankle-Dribble, Cut-Step into Calf Dribble (driving knee forward)
	- **Drop and Pop** — short box, come down and immediately cut-step into hurdle pop-over
- **Box-Drill** — tip hurdle over at 36”, legs towards the runner (crossbar sets “landing area”)
	- striking down and cycling over, landing *inside* the landing area
	- Training to attack down and back off the hurdle to carry momentum forward
## Dynamic Drills
#### One-Step Hurdling
- Initial Feel of Takeoff and Touchdown Rhythm
- Active Cycling of lead/trail
- Repping specific hurdle-movements
- Usually placed after initial warmup / static-drills
- Start with wickets or scissor-hurdles to learn — modify old hurdles w/lower heights
- Highly-coordinated — ability dictates height
- Drills:
	- **1-Step Leads** — 3-5ft spacing (stretch w/proficiency / need)
	- **1-Step Trails** — same spacing
	- **1-Step Over-the-Top** — putting Lead/Trail together, just continuous takeoffs
	- **1-Step (Vertical Focused)** — 5-Steps with shorter hurdles (18”?), working on snapping trail up
		- More for mens high-hurdles (where you need strong vertical hip-projection)
	- **1-Step (Horizontal Focused)** — 12ish steps
		- emphasize projection into hurdle and carrying speed between
#### 3-Step Hurdling
- 12-22 steps in between hurdles (depends on level of athlete)
	- Women: 12-18 steps (15) — Men: 15-22 steps (18)
- Focus on quick turnover “shuffling” frequency between
- Same Progressions as 1-Step Hurdling
- Start with wickets/scissor-hurdles to learn rhythm
- Slower speed to begin, then progress faster and closer
- Posture can stay taller throughout the drill — speed dictates the lean
#### 5-Step Hurdling
- Good for teaching the mens high-hurdlers to shuffle through when they can’t take full strides
	- May not need to teach as much shuffling for hurdlers with less power-output, as they can push for longer strides between the hurdles
## Starting Drills / Ideas
- Purpose-Driven Starts — setting up a proper takeoff will fix a lot of subsequent problems
### Coaching for an 8-Step Pattern (Strides to First Hurdle)
*side-note: there is some individualization / bandwidth depending on height of hurdler, etc.*
##### Mens: (per hurdle — cumulative distance)
- 0.65m
- 1.24 — 1.89m
- 1.36 — 3.25m
- 1.46 — 4.71m
- 1.60 — 6.31m
- 1.74 — 8.05m
- 1.84 — 9.89m
- 1.74 — 11.63m
##### Womens: (per hurdle — cumulative distance)
- 0.60m
- 1.16 — 1.76m
- 1.33 — 3.09m
- 1.43 — 4.52m
- 1.53 — 6.05m
- 1.63 — 7.68m
- 1.73 — 9.41m
- 1.63 — 11.04m
### 6-Step Starts
Allows the athlete to focus on pushing, covering a lot of ground off the start.
- Moving the hurdle to the 6-step mark — athlete still starts at the same mark as an 8-Step Accel
- Discount the hurdle by a foot or so — athlete won’t have as much speed coming in
- Takeoff Distance — ~6.5 foot-lengths back
	- 6-6.5 foot-lengths for women
	- 6.5-7 foot-lengths for men
## Long-Hurdle Specific Drills
- **2-Step Hurdling** — athletes need to learn how to lead with either leg more in the 300s
	- 12ft or so between wicket-hurdles
- **Rhythm Runs** — wickets, just working on steering ability and spacing out between hurdles
	- 18m, 20m, can do them at 35m (race-distance), just changing up the speed for the athlete
