# How to 3-Step in the Hurdles
Assumption: Speed is Not an Issue. Fix that first, if that’s the case.
## Three Common Issues
- Plant-Step — needs to be under the hurdler, not out in front
- Landing — needs to be a one-foot landing to preserve momentum
- Stride Inefficiency — bad arm action (twisting), choppy strides
	- Thinking about high-knee coming into the hurdle, followed by the low sweep of the cut-step
## Fixing Problems
- Discounting Hurdles — more efficient, better tech, muscle memory
- Low-Impact Hurdle Drills — muscle-memory, practicing form
