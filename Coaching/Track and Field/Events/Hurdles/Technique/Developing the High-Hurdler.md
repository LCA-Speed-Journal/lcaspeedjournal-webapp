# Developing the High-Hurdler

## Technical Components to Hurdling
### Takeoff
Key Points:
- Distance from the hurdle (collegians) — 7ft for men, 6.5ft for women (6-8ft)
	- Mileage will vary depending on the age-group/experience — less power a closer takeoff
- Lean forward from the hip, not from the waist
- Driving the knee of the lead leg up + FWD
- Strong push-off from the back-leg
### Cut-Step
Key Points:
- Final Stride before takeoff — shorter, and quicker than the preceding strides
- Low to the ground to maintain momentum
- Foot-placement is the key factor in a smooth transition
Drills:
- Wall-Drill: Step and Push-Thru, projecting lead-leg over barrier and stopping at the wall
	- To practice the cut-step, take one or two steps back so they can practice cutting the final step a little shorter for more horizontal projection
- Moving Cut-Step: hurdle tipped over (crossbar on the athlete-side), athlete marches between hurdles — Step inside the crossbar, then snap the dribble up and over top

### Hurdle Clearance
*Focus on minimizing time spent over top, not height above the hurdle.*
Key Points:
- Lead Leg — driving forward and slightly upward
	- Maintain straight lead-leg with slight bend (at knee) upon clearance
	- Actively pull lead leg down after clearing the hurdle, don’t just let it drop
- Torso and Arms — forward lean to lower COM
	- Opposite arm drives forward, parallel to the lead leg
	- Need to maintain balance and momentum, while keeping torso low (streamlined)
### Trail Leg
*Trail Leg is the key to maintain both speed and rhythm through the hurdles.*
Key Points:
- Pull trail leg through quickly, and close to the body
- Focus on driving with the knee, while keeping the heel tight to the butt
- Extend trail leg forward for the next stride
- Minimize lateral movement — foot should come through pointing forward, not sideways
- Faster trail leg = shorter GCT (and consequently, faster time between hurdles)
## Drills and Training
#### Takeoff Drills
- Cut-Step Walk
- lead-leg skips (Spacing: 1 hurdle apart)
#### Cut-Step Drills
- Wall Cut-Step, Walking Cut-Step
- Ankle/Calf Dribbles
#### Hurdle Clearance Drills
-  Walking Hurdles, 
- lead-leg drills
#### Trail Leg Drills
- Wall rotation (hurdle spacing: 2-2.5x Foot-Length from wall)
- trail-leg skips (Spacing: 1 hurdle apart)
#### Rhythm and Spacing Drills
- 1-Step Drills: 1-hurdle apart for drilling continuous takeoffs, 
- 3-Step, 5-Step drills
	- with jammed spacing, irregular spacing, etc.
#### Misc Notes
- Strength and Conditioning
- Flexibility and Mobility
## Common Mistakes
- Taking off too far from (or too close to) the hurdle
	- Correction — marking the takeoff point (tape, etc.)
- Choppy strides between hurdles
	- Correction — need to work shuffling drills, 5-step drills, continuous drills
- High hips during the clearance (“jumping over”) 
	- Correction — establishing the takeoff mark clearer (flatten the parabola)
- Wide trail leg
	- Correction — trail-leg rotation drill, cueing to keep the heel tight to the butt
