# Training the Intermediate Hurdles

## Keys to the Intermediates
- First priority is Acceleration, then Speed Development, then Speed Endurance
	- Speed Reserve
- Short-Hurdle Workouts can be used to also train for the long-hurdles (particularly when space is limited, weather is rough, etc.)
	- Modifications: slightly shorter recovery, slightly increased sets/reps
- Event Modeling is important for the 300mH, when we usually associate it more with the 100mH
	- Hurdles 1-2-3 are adrenaline (need to be careful to be smooth in the accel)
	- Hurdles 4-5-6 are where the race begins to develop and show
	- Hurdles 7-8 are the capacity and toughness-driven hurdles
- Arm-action needs to stay aggressive, but low — don’t get up into accel arms
	- Leading with the elbow as we’re coming over top, not with the hands
	- if really stuck: Karate-Chop down gets better results than taking arm across the neck
- Practice steering — long and short setups (20-10-15-25m runs)
- Not usually mixing the rhythms (high-hurdles and low-hurdles in same practice)
	- Exceptions exist, (see callout)
> [!TIP] Mixed Hurdle-Rhythm Day
> *(beware, higher-volume, not our style — could be used as something lactic-adjacent)*
> - 3-4 x 3-5 HH Low-and-Close
> - 10-15min water-break
> - 1x350m @ 75% — 90s break — Stand at hurdle 4 and run to the finish

### Strength Endurance Training (Speed-Endurance)
9-9-9 Method
- More than 9 Reps — More than 90m — More than 9 seconds
- With Resistance or a Load (hill, etc.)
> [!WARNING] Coach-Ross Commentary
> …that’s a lot of volume for the high-schooler. 
> At minimum, looking at over 800m of work. Add in additional resistance, and that’s a hell of a lot of stimulus.
> *I’d stay away from this one.*
