# How and Why to Discount Hurdles
Definition: any time the height/distance of the hurdle is manipulated
## Why:
- Introduce a newer hurdler to lower-heights and shorter distances
- Allows for more technical execution
## How: 
- 6” Discount on the 1st Hurdle (or 1 foot-length)
- 2-Step Discount for the 2nd Hurdle (or 3 foot discount from mark)
## Reminders
- 3-5 Sets at most (if traveling over 2 hurdles p/set)
