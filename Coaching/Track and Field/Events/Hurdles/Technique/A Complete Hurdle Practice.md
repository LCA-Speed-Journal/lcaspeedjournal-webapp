# A Complete Hurdle Practice
## Drills
### Wall Lead-Leg Drill (Lead-Leg Cut-Step Drill)
- 3 sets of 8 Reps or 2 Sets p/leg
- Not just about foot on the wall — leading with bent knee
	- Trying to keep somewhat bent, pressing into wall
- Keeping arm-action clean — what matters is coming off square
- Working on the cut step by swinging the last step low before projecting through
	- Not leading with the heel, should be striking ball-of-foot
	- Foot should be striking under the hip, then sending thru
### Wall Trail-Leg Drill
- 3 Sets of 8-10 Reps or 2 Sets p/leg
- Hurdle should be far enough from wall that athlete isn’t kneeing the wall, but shouldn’t be so far that they need to break at waist to reach back
- Heel needs to be ahead of the crossbar
- Need to be slow, purposeful — don’t just swing up & around
- Knee should stay higher than the foot at all times
	- Coaching Cue — “Kneeing someone in the Chest”
- Toe should be up and out, Heel should be tight to the butt
- Can manually block the athlete’s heel by holding hands just above heel
	- If athlete hits hand, tells them they’re lifting heel early
### Walkovers
- Lead Leg (3 Sets of 4 Hurdles, or 2 Sets p/leg)
	- Straight-Up, Straight-Down — Just exaggerate the knee-drive
	- Keep clean arm-action
	- Don’t crowd the hurdle — lead to kicking the knee out
		- Can constrain by putting leg even with the side post
	- If too short to clear easily, just do out to the side
- Trail Leg (3 Sets of 4 Hurdles, or 2 Sets p/leg)
	- Similar to being on the wall — need to step past the crossbar
- Full Walkovers (3 Sets of 4 Hurdles, or 2 Sets p/leg)
	- Can be difficult for shorter hurdlers, need to keep posture tall
### Skip-Overs
- Lead-Leg (3 Sets of 4 Hurdles, or 2 Sets p/leg)
	- Will expose if you crowd the hurdle — leg kicks out or will clip the hurdle
- Trail-Leg (3 Sets of 4 Hurdles, or 2 Sets p/leg)
