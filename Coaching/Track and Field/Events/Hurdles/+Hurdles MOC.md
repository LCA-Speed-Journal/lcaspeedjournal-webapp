# Hurdles

Hurdle-specific programming and technique materials

## Programming

- [[+Hurdles Training]]: Combined hurdling model MOC organizing general philosophy (lower-volume, higher-intensity), key drills (low-impact, warmup, sub-max work), and practice structuring for speed days, X-factor days, and strength days.
- [[Coaching Philosophy for The Hurdles]]: [[Andreas Behm]] (Altis) philosophy on hurdling covering takeoff spacing, discount hurdle heights for younger athletes, training frequency (2x p/wk), talent identification, and typical long-hurdle session structure.

## Technique

- [[A Complete Hurdle Practice]]: Complete hurdle practice structure from Feed the Cats including wall drills (lead-leg and trail-leg), walkovers (lead, trail, full), skip-overs, speed drills, and full-speed reps with discount height/distance guidelines.
- [[Developing the High-Hurdler]]: [[Selwyn Maxwell]] (UCONN) technical components covering takeoff (distance, lean, knee drive), cut-step (shorter final stride, drills), hurdle clearance (minimizing time over top), trail leg mechanics, and associated drills for each component.
- [[FTC Hurdle-Drills]]: Feed the Cats hurdle drill sequence including lead-leg and trail-leg wall drills, lead-leg and trail-leg walkovers and skipovers, and full walkovers with brief descriptions.
- [[FTC Hurdle-Practice (Summary)]]: Summary checklist of Feed the Cats hurdle practice components from wall drills through full-speed reps over 1-2 hurdles.
- [[How and Why to Discount Hurdles]]: Explanation of discount hurdling (lower heights, closer distances) for introducing newer hurdlers, allowing better technical execution, with specific discount guidelines (6" or 1 foot-length on first hurdle, 2-step discount on second).
- [[How to 3-Step in the Hurdles]]: Guide to 3-stepping in hurdles assuming adequate speed, covering three common issues (plant-step placement, landing mechanics, stride inefficiency) and fixing problems through discounting and low-impact drills.
- [[How to Cut-Step in the Hurdles]]: Explanation of cut-step technique (transfer of vertical to horizontal force) with key cues: striking with ball-of-foot, landing under hip, setting up well into first hurdle with strong acceleration.
- [[Hurdle Drills (Chris Parno)]]: Comprehensive hurdle drill system from [[Chris Parno]] (MSU Mankato) covering static drills, dynamic drills, in-place/walking drills, equipment usage, warmup examples, and specialized problem-solving drills.
- [[Hurdle Drills Explained]]: Brief explanations of key hurdle drills including walkovers (lead/trail, 4 hurdles, ~6 steps between), skip-overs (rhythm work), and wall drills (3 sets of 8-10, height guidelines by age/gender).
- [[The Sprint Hurdles System]]: System overview covering cycle drill, one-step drill, cycle-ladder drill, jammed hurdling, seven-stepping, hurdle-endurance, and starts (standing, push-up, block) with video references and progression guidelines.
- [[Training the Intermediate Hurdles]]: [[Tony Veney]] (USATF Master Coach) approach to 300m hurdles covering keys (acceleration, speed development, speed endurance), event modeling (hurdles 1-3 adrenaline, 4-6 race development, 7-8 capacity), arm action, steering practice, and strength endurance training methods.
- [[Training Youth Hurdlers]]: Brief guide to safely training youth hurdlers emphasizing low-impact hurdle drills for technique development and discounting (low and close spacing) when hurdlers are ready.
- [[Training Youth Hurdles (Safe Effective)]]: Guide for safe and effective youth hurdle training using low-impact drills for technique development and discounted hurdle spacing (low and close) as athletes progress.
