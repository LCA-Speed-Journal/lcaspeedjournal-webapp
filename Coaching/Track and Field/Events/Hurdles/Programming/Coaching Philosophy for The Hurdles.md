# Coaching Philosophy for The Hurdles

## Hurdlers
- Takeoff Spacing — if you can get proper spacing on takeoff, it cleans things up down the line
	- Often a Perceptual Understanding of “where do I take off from?”
	- Give them a Takeoff Mark, then have the athlete take 8-12 steps back and *look* for where it is relative to their original perception
- Younger Hurdlers — Use as Low of a Hurdle as you Need (and don’t be afraid to do that)
	- Discount spacing, make them tighter so the athlete can get a *feel* for 3-stepping
	- General Thought is practicing over heights that are below comp-height, but there are exceptions where athletes need comp-height to feel ready
- Hurdling 2x p/wk — Start based Session (Short, Technical) + Long-Hurdles Session (more reps)
	- Additionally, doing Speed and Speed-Endurance
- Talent Identification — Fast Athletes, Fearless Athletes, Coordinated Athletes
	- Jumpers translate well (in-air coordination), Gymnasts translate well
- Preparing Young Athletes — Work on General Coordination (Dribbling, Multijumps) First
### Typical Training: Long-Hurdle Session
- Longer Warmup (45-60min)
- “Bridge Activity” — Bridging the Warmup into the Main Activity
	- e.g. dribbles, fast-leg work, switching drills, etc.
- Hurdle-Drills (3-4 drills p/workout session)
	- Skipping, One-Stepping, Quick Three-Stepping, Approach-Work
- 4-6 Reps of 6-12 Hurdles
	- wouldn’t do say, 5x12 straight — need to factor discount-height, ladder reps (10, 8, 6, etc.)
	- don’t progress athletes unless they’re ready — rigid timeline not appropriate (some might progress in a week, some night take 2-3)
## Sprinters
### Acceleration
Characteristics:
- Forward Oriented Torso — Head in Alignment
- Neutral / Aligned Pelvis
- Aggressively Scissoring Thighs
- Shin Angle — Attacking Back
Drills:
- scissoring drills, 
- hip extension/projection (skipping for length is a good way to hit this one)
