# Combined Hurdling Model
## General Philosophy
- Big Idea: lower-volume, higher-intensity model — as [[Alec Holler]]
	- Caveat: not as restrictive when it comes to *only* doing full-speed hurdles
- Consistent drilling with low-impact work at multiple points in the week
	- Always: Hurdle-Specific Mobility Drills 
	- Speed/X-Factor Days: [[A Complete Hurdle Practice|FTC Low-Impact Drills]], Statics from [[Hurdle Drills (Chris Parno)|Parno Drills]]
	- Strength-Days: Hurdle-Targeted Strength (Hip-Flexors / Glute-Med)
- Full-Speed Hurdling should be the priority
	- Acceleration to the First Hurdle (8-Step Acceleration)
	- Full-Speed over Discount-Hurdles
	- 3-Step Practice between Discount-Spacing
- Microdose sub-maximal work on X-Factor days to work rhythm/technique on days where we might not be fully in a speed-focus
