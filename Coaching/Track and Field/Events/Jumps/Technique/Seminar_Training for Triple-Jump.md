## First Phase is Key
Even more than the first phase, the **entry** into the first phase (2-3 steps prior, and ofc the approach)
- Cycling Practice
- Lots of hip strength (anterior hip)
## Starting Small
- Step-Overs — foot on Box as “takeoff leg”. Pull over box, aiming for horizontal hip projection
	- Can add on a cycle of 1st phase
	- Can add a light band behind hips to encourage projection out
- SL Hopping — ~1x p/wk, 20m p/leg or so
- Bounding (levels of bounding — 1, 2, 3 — each is just a different level of sub-max)
- Box-Phases
- Landings
- Box-Bounding
- Run-to-Bound
- Run-to-1st-Phase
- Consecutive 1st-Phase
- Short Approach Full-Phase
- Wicket-Runs (shorter/submax for posture, full-distance/speed as a progression)
## Frequency of Full-Jumps
- Bounding — all the time
- Full-Phase Jumps — 1x p/wk, 3-4 Reps p/session
### Coach Creech’s Structure
Every-Day — Straight-Leg Bounding (in the warmup)
Early-Week — Lower-Leg Plyos + Approaches
Late-Week — Ground/Tech-Work, Skips, etc.
