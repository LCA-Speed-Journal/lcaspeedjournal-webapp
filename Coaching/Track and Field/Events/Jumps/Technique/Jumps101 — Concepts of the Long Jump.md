# Jumps101 — Concepts of the Long Jump
## The Approach
95% of the Long-Jump is based on the approach (similar to [[+High-Jump 101]] ideology)
### Measuring the Approach
Cone at 100ft, measure a cone to a 6-Step Approach — New Start Point is the difference
	Example: Start at 100ft — 6th Step lands at 70ft — New Start = 30ft
Repeat Process for 10 Step, 14 Step, and 18 Step Approach
## Applied Approach
### 6-Step Approach
- Drive — First 2 Steps, really pushing out
- Acceleration — Head Up, accelerating and trying to build speed
- Top-End — No more trying to get faster, working steps to being underneath the body
### 10-Step Approach
- Drive — 4 Step Drive-Phase
- Top-End — 
### 14-Step Approach
- Drive — 6-Step Drive-Phase
- Acceleration — Steps 7-10
- Top-End — Steps 11-14
### 18-Step Approach
- Drive — 6-Step (head down until step 7)
- Accel — 6-Step (head coming up, working to build speed with pressure)
- Top-End — 6-Step (preparing for takeoff, hips coming under, “letting speed go”)
## Sweet Spot
Not always better to jump to a further approach, as more speed means less time to match the alignment of linear speed with bounce. Need to gauge appropriate approach distance based on how well the athlete is timing the rhythm off the board.
## Long-Jump Entry
- Looking for a big split, attacking down, staying stacked
- Attacking the board with a flat foot
### Practice Elements
- Gallop to Pop-Up — 
- 6-Step Pop-Up — Focused on keeping same positions from the Gallop Drill
	- Beware of casing penult too far in front of the body — will act as brake at higher speeds
## Riding the Board
The period of time from contact until leaving the board
- Want to delay the flight-phase mechanics until you’ve left the board, else overrotation happens
## Flight Patterns
- Hang
- Hitch
