# Mentality
## Goal Setting
Set the Intention, then break into Long-Term and Short-Term Goals
- Short Term is a natural extension of the Long-Term Goals (how to get there)
## Training Gear
### Offseason Gear
Getting stronger, conditioning, developing GPP. Shoe that’s durable, functional, and protective.
	Don’t use shoes that are lower-profile, thinner, etc. — can increase impacts, degredation
### In-Season Gear
Nike Rival MD — good intro-level spike for multis (heel-support, but still spikes on the forefoot)
Adidas Adizero Long-Jump — good event-specific shoe
Do **not** use sprint-spikes to jump in, particularly because of the flat-foot contact at the board.
## LEAP Philosophy
- Develop — Develop the physical body to handle the loads
- Training — Train the body and mind to work together
- Compete — Showcase Talents and Perform
### Training Cycles
- Cycle 1 — Muscular and Cardiovascular Endurance
- Cycle 2 — Stationary Plyos and Speed Development
- Cycle 3 — Runway Work, Technique, and Consistency
### Weight Training vs Functional Training
Weights — Strong, Resilient, and Durable
- Cons — Slower, Higher Injury Risk (hm, not sure), and Age-Restrictive (hm, not sure)
Functional Training — Strong, Elastic, and Flexible
- Cons — n/a (really?)
### Key Elements
- Hip-Girdle — The Key Balance
- Soleus — Key to Forward Propulsion
- Adductors — Key to Alignment
- Abductors — Key to Stability
- Back — Key to Posture
- Glutes — Key to Movement
