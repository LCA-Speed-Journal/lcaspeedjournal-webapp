# Triple Jump Concepts
## The Approach
Doesn’t reccomend a an 18 step approach for the triple jump
- Most schools don’t have a long enough runway
- Can bring too much speed into the jump (harder to control)
## Double Arm Entry
- Double arm can take an athlete too high off the approach.
	- Cue a “bump” off the hips instead for more horizontal projection
	- Alternately, can pause penult-arm back to wind, then send both on the takeoff
## Single Arm Entry
- Single Over-the-Top — Punch forward, opposite sweeps up and over the top
	- Example (L Foot Takeoff-Leg): L Punches, R sweeps up and over while L comes back to load for Step-Phase
	- Alternately, can punch forward and up, so both arms end up overhead (opposing arcs)
## Triple Entry and Posture
Biggest thing is consistent position — Figure-4, Big-Split, Downward-Attack, etc.
- Strides also need to be consistent — should almost feel “faster” than rest of the approach
	- Slight shortening in stride-length, if getting into the details
- Attacking down at the board, strong projection outwards, blocking with swing-leg
- Slight lowering of the hips on penult, but should strive for “tall” posture
- Cueing to “push the board backwards” to accelerate through the takeoff
## Hop Phase Checkpoints
- Beginner athletes will “pogo” their takeoff leg instead of extending the stride
	- Emphasize the recovery of the jump-leg — pulling heel through, knee coming forward
- Ideally, turn block-leg into “drop-leg” after the takeoff — “Skywalker Effect”
	- Slows the rotation to give the athlete more time to pull the takeoff leg through with good recovery mechanics
	- Knee Drives, then relaxes — extend leg to reach down
## Step Phase Checkpoints
Want to be using the Step Phase like a bound — big split, negative foot-speed
- Sweeping the opposite leg through — thinking of the ankles passing one another
- Need the Hop phase to have adequate height, but not so much height that you crash into step
## Jump Phase Checkpoints
Similar “sweeping” to the step-phase, just not placing the stance-leg as far in front of the body
