# Jumps101 — Training Drills
## Bounding
The “secret sauce” to jumps development.
- Patience is the key — swinging with rhythmic force, big split
- Goal is to cover the most ground per step, with full-foot contacts
## Combo Bounding — Hop-Bounds (LL-RR)
- Looking for heel tuck at the takeoff, good knee split, and not collapsing upon contact
- Great place to practice full-foot contacts, arm action drop-leg, etc.
## Hop Progression Drills
### Standing Touch Drill
- Use a mini hurdle — place R-Leg on the hurdle, and hop L-Leg up and over (or vice-versa)
	- Want to maintain contact with the mini-hurdle, but not crush it
	- When hopping up and over, want to emphasize good mechanics (recovery, etc)
### Takeoff Projection Drill
- Training athletes not to cycle out of the takeoff — pulling free-leg through, thigh parallel to ground (lifting knee to hip height) and directing down towards box (rather than cycling through)
	- to a Knee-Height Box
### Hop-Recovery Drill
- Partner holding free-leg at ~90° knee-bend, stance leg under hips
	- Pulling knee straight through—think Figure-4—and extending out to land with heel-contact
- Not a high-impact drill — just for understanding positions and correct path of movement
### Arm Drive to Takeoff
- From Standing — swing free leg through (sweeping past ankle) to takeoff into pit
	- Use arm action to give more vertical impulse — should see a little bit of height
	- Want to emphasize knee-lift to carry the athlete out into the pit
	- Will see positive shin angle before takeoff, don’t want to be taking off straight up
### Jogging Touch Drill
- Using a mini hurdle — as the standing touch drill, just with a few steps to bring speed into it
- Still looking for good mechanics on the hop-leg, and the relaxation of the drop-leg
- Can progress into a Hop-Step to get the second phase a little
- Can progress further back and add wickets (Dribble to Hop)
### Advanced Hop Drilling — Repeat Hops
- No more than 3x in a row
- Looking for a drop-leg and a strong projection of the hop-leg to cover distance
- Want to be doing this on grass or some other yielding surface, as impacts are very high
## Step Phase Development
### Step to Jump
- Taking the hop out — taking some speed into the phase, big projection out
- Big split — back leg long, front leg projected out in front
- Swinging with the ankle on contact to carry into the jump — “sweeping”
- 15-17ft from the pit (girls vs boys) – should be 3-4ft from sand landing off the step-phase
## Jump Phase Development and Landing
### Drop-In Approach Jump
- Dropping in off a short box — should be projecting out
- One-Foot takeoff, but emphasize vertical impulse (can place an object at height, to reach for)
