# Field-Work with Boo Shexnayder
## Four Issues
- Pathological Gait Problems — Training Issues, not Teaching Issues
	- Mobility/Flexibility Restrictions, Strength Deficit/Imbalance, etc.
	- Answer: don’t overteach, need to tweak training (diverse strength-work, etc.)
	- A lot of these types of problems is overuse — means you don’t need to zero in on a drill or two, need to make sure the athletes are getting varied stimulus to prevent falling into an overuse rut
- Global Factors —
	- Posture — Alignment of the Head and Alignment of the Pelvis are the most important
		- Want neutral head, neutral pelvis
	- Ranges of Motion
		- Thinking about the thigh-bone as a pendulum, swinging back and forth
	- Levels of Stability
- Self-Organizing Skills — 
	- Arm-Action — don’t need to coach it, will respond naturally to balance what’s happening in the lower
	- Strong Leg vs Coordinated Leg — can do an approach vert off one-leg to find, strong is the jump-leg
- “Things you Have to Teach” —
	- Use the Global things as Context, don’t worry as much about Pathological and Self-Organizing
### Stance on 2-Pt start: toes pointed ahead, feet just over a shoe’s length apart
- Setting the Shin — cue the athletes to shift knee over toe, feel how shins tip forwards
	- False-Stepping is a re-organizing due to poor shin angles (naturally finding places to push from)
- Drop — Dropping Chest and Arms
- Arms — placing in opposition
- Start — Driving Out
	- Sending hips through (don’t worry about staying low, will lead to unnecessary break @ waist)
	- Novice athletes need more vertical component — that’s where a 2pt stance is easier to pick up
## Building Towards Upright
- Cueing to push hard, feeling like you’re climbing steps or climbing a ladder
	- Not only pushing out, we’re also pushing up — shouldn’t have to force the posture-change, should be a byproduct of driving
	- With each push, our hips are coming further and further through (underneath the body)
	-  Common Athlete Trap — Lifting the head/chest up without hips coming as well 
		- (end up with overly flexed in the lumbar)
> [!TIP] Pro Tip on Cueing for Feeling: One-Side
> Cueing one side of the body allows the athlete to zero in on a smaller scope, and the other side is likely to mirror unconsciously.
## Coaching the Distribution
“The increase in cadence needs to be patient: if at any time you sacrifice ROM or posture, you’ve paid too high of a price.”
- What might be faster with respect to time, might not *feel* faster to the athlete
	- Need to make them aware of this, it may feel counterintuitive at times.
- Coaches need to focus on things below the waist, for the most part, and not worry so much about what’s happening up top (exceptions to this rule, of course, but for the most part)
