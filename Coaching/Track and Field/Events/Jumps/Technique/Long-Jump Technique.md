# **Approach**
### Vision at the Start
- Eyes on the board is encouraged, but eventually moves to peripheral
### Start closer to upright/moderate accel-angle
- Thigh-Split Yes, Shins Match Spine
- Pushing into Upright
	- *Too* much push can turn into bounding-look, which leads to shin-cast 
	- (hence looking for shin to match spine)
- Aggressive, but not maximal — continuous and rhythmic build
### Consistent Start
(a roll-in can be 30cm variance by the time you’re at the board)
Even just adding a little hop at the start can wildly throw off where you end up.
### Upright by Step 6-8
- Tracking the board at this point
### Uniform Accel – Crescendo – Speed (Distribute the Run and the Energy Usage)
- Sufficient, Patient Push, get Pelvis into Neutral
	- [[Dan Pfaff]] — “If you have a 9V battery, and you use 7V in the approach, you’re in trouble by takeoff”
	- Want to meter the accel, be patent in the building so we’re spiking speed by the time we’re at the board
- Smooth transition from start to upright, max (controlled) accel, push and spine are harmonic
- Up to 90-95% maxV – it’s still LJ, there’s an optimal cost to setting up a good penult/takeoff mechanism
	- Start should be about 80-90%, but don’t dip too low for relative-effort (leaning too far into patience)
- LJ is a 2:1 horizontal to vertical relationship
### Postural Alignment – Accel-Transition-Upright-Takeoff-Flight
- Head
	- spine aligned with pelvis, 
	- shin-angles match spine
- Shank
	- ~Perpendicular at ground-strike, 
	- free-leg heel-to-butt, 
	- knees are together in mid-stance
- Measure Inclination while knees are *together*
### Amplitude of Movement (running originates from hips)
(See [[USTFCCA]] for more course-material on the jumps)
- Preserve undulation of COM
	- oscillation of pelvis creates stretch-reflex in hip-extensors/flexors, and spine
	- [[Ken Clark]] and [[Peter Weyand]] — Whip from the Hip
- Full-ROM Sprinting, but fast
	- stepping over the knee, free leg close to parallel, heel behind knee
- Dorsiflex
- Strike firmly, and vertical
	- toe in line with the spine pushing up (will likely be a *little* past the spine)
- Key —  generating hip extension while aligning posture
- Femur is the pendulum, working the large arc of ROM
### A “Run to the Penultimate” — Ground the Penult in a Tall-Position
- Build thru the mid-approach with full optimal stride-length
- Crescendo right into (and through) the penult
- Maintain posture, amplitude, and build speed thru the penult
- Up until front-side of penult, it should look no different than a normal sprint
	- Penult should be flat and subtle — connects to the “Toe-Toe-Toe-Flat-Flat” drill
	- Don’t let hips sink too far, too much dip will kill momentum
	- Mistake — overcoaching the penult (oops), gets athlete too hyper-focused on it
### Relaxed, Reflexive (Patient Aggression)
- Creates an “elastic environment,” freedom for the pelvis to move, and optimizes bounce off board
- Small bounce naturally helps carry into bigger bounce
- Relaxed posture should carry thru approach, penult, takeoff, and landing
### Think about the Run having more focus than the Jump (Run > Jump)
- Keep vertical push through the final 4-steps (bounce), preserve the range of motion
- Vertical environment in latter-stages of the run, striking firm right up to the penult (don’t soften)
### Steering is Normal, some Adjustments are Normal
### Adjustments (Steering, Spotting, etc) Earlier is Better
Preserve the Final 4 Steps, should be the most reflexive and relaxed (makes sense since they’re the fastest)
### Nothing Special in Hitting Board — Special = Rhythm and Lining up the Sequence
---
# Common Errors in the Approach
### Starting too Low
### Too Fast @ the Start, or Bounding
### Disjointed Rhythm
### Anticipatory Movements
- Prepping for takeoff while mid-approach
- Inclination
- Slowing in Final 4
- Softened Steps in Final 4
- Incomplete Pushes in Final 4
### Floating in the Middle (not continuing to Strike Down)
- Cutting off the ability to develop momentum
- Casting
- Anterior-Pelvic-Tilt — Hard to regain hip-position
### Heightened Frequency into Takeoff, Cutting off ROM (hip-tightening)
- Reduced ROM = False-Speed, shuffling, shin-angles tilted back
- Squatty-Running (should be more for Accel), sitting down — Pseudo-Speed
- Sacrificing Stride Length and smoothness — strides need to get quicker, but also longer (full-ROM)
	- Frequency isn’t by itself a “bad thing,” but it’s bad when it pulls from the other components
### Bracing for Impact
- Casting Shins
### Applying Accel-Mechanics in MaxV
- Over-Pushing, leads to many issues:
	- losing pelvic position
	- longer GCT
	- low recovery-heights
	- reaching/casting
	- compromised ROM
	- loss of elasticity
### False-Premises/Beliefs in what Approach/Takeoff Are
- Try-Hard or Muscle-Driven Mentality is the Killer

# **Penult and Takeoff**
### Postural Integrity
- Sprint Posture thru takeoff into flight, including head
- Neutral Pelvis — Key
### Quiet Landing on Penult — Flat/Quiet Takeoff
- Amortization — elasticity spring up off the board as you pass it — Displacement
	- (connects to [[[(CSAC-1) Profiling#The Role of Eccentric Forces|CSAC-Profiling: the Role of ECC-Forces]])
- Graceful, gentle, smooth — not an Earthquake
	- Coming back to thoughts on not being overly force-driven
	- (reminds of [[Les Spellman]] talking about the over-dominance of CON-Focused training)
- Bridging — lower in *front* of the penult, compress on the board, then spring off
	- Roller Coaster(?)
### Tight Takeoff (% of Takeoff with Hips Past Board)
- Vertical lift from a short takeoff — feel like you’re “on top of takeoff”
- Trust putting foot down barely in front — let run and elasticity “do the jump for you”
	- (Connects to the “Short” part of the “SSS-Long-Short” drill — **need to revise this to prevent sitting**)
- Heel doesn’t come up to butt, but slides by/below calf (blocking low)
### Jump Late
- Jumping *past* the board, leaving the foot behind
	- (connects to [[Dario Saisan (SaisanTraining)]] and his thoughts on [[Delayed Knee Extension]])
- Not behind the board, but in *front* of — biomechanics gives the height, not crushing the board
	- **stop cueing a “punch the board” for the jumpers. Not helpful.**
- Feel a “pushing up” as you pass the board
- Put foot down, then let yourself travel to the other side of the takeoff — body knows to go up, need to go later
	- Can be a scary / counterintuitive thing, but need to trust
### Run (Past || Thru || to the Other Side of || Up and Away From) the Board
- DISPLACEMENT is the key — move forward, leave the penult leg back (use the stretch-reflex)
- Free-distance by “holding onto the board” — swing free leg through a large arc and project the hips
	- Hips forward is more important than knee-up
- Paradoxical to “letting the sprint do the jumping”
	- both things can be true, but we shouldn’t overprep the jump earlier in the Final 4
### Set Foot on the Board, then Move to the Other Side
- Glute-Ham-Quad — in that order
	- (connects to Glute-Hip Reflex-Arc mentioned in [[RPR]])
- Elastic Response — using unconscious stretch-reflexes will spring you off the board
- Amortization-Compression, *then* spring up — hips passing the takeoff foot
- Place foot down, yield, then drive through hips to push off the board late
#### Prep-Work: Quad-ISOs
- Don’t want to paw at the ground, want to support through vasti
#### Big Split off the Board
- Big swing of the free-leg, helping carry forward and drive hips
#### Jump is based on Instinct
- Don’t need to Force
#### Be a Passenger — Line Things Up, then Let Stretch-Reflexes / Speed do the Work
- Elasticity will do the job, over-forcing will override that and lead to weaker pop
#### Steering
- Natural tendency is to hit the target midfoot/arch
- Need to recalibrate — back of the board with the midfoot (arch is half on the track, half on the board)
#### ‘Feel’ the Jump in the Quad, and the “Pushing Up” at Toe-Off
#### Light, Smooth, Relaxed — Move thru Takeoff, Keep Moving Forward
#### “Place Foot on Board → Move Thru → Just Take What the Body Gives You” -Eric Burns (Loyola)

# Common Errors in Penult / Takeoff
#### Stomping/Stopping the Penult
- Lowering in flight instead of in support
- Loud is *bad* — stopping
#### Hopping onto the Penultimate
- Last 1-2 steps before the actual penult looking closer to bounding
- Might be paired with leaning back
#### Rising too Quick off Penult (cutting off Vertical-Impulse)
#### “Forcing the Takeoff” — Pounding the Board, Blocking (a tech-piece more for HJ)
- Looking more like “vaulting” over the board
	- minimizes the ability to drive through
- Makes the event muscle-driven rather than elastic/reflexive
- Jumping behind the board — Inclination or “leaning”
- Misperception of “needing to work the takeoff hard”
#### Inverse Muscle-Firing
- Quad-Ham-Glute (again, [[RPR]] reflex-arc])
#### Stopping at the Board, or “Board as the Finish Line”
- Slowing down and “loading the jump” rather than finishing through
- Re-Cue with “treat the end of the pit as the finish line” to take pressure away from the board
#### Planting or Bracing
- Jumping before the board
- Fighting against the takeoff
- Locking out the Knee
#### Pawing instead of Placing
- Going too early, misfiring/misusing the tissues, not using the elastic properties
#### Head-Throw
#### Reaching at Takeoff (Over-Loading)
#### Plantar-Flexing instead of Full-Foot-Contact
#### Driving the Knee Early — Flexion-Reflex (leads to “Artificial Knee-Drive)

---
# **Flight and Landing**
#### Sprint Posture
- Keep this thru the landing
- Effective Landing Distance
#### Stay Linear
- Feet are in Front
- Posture is Tall
- Slightly Flexed to help Absorb
#### Elongation of Free-Leg to Counter the Over-Rotation
- Extend the Free-Leg down to slow over-rotation
	- reminiscent of Triple-tech for the 1st Phase — turns the body into a long lever, harder to rotate
- Angular Momentum of the free-leg helps counter the over-rotation into the pit
#### Relaxed, but Aware
#### Arm-Sweep
#### Moving into Landing Position *sooner* Rather than Later
#### Slide to the Side *After* Hitting Sand

---
# Common Errors in Flight / Landing
#### Anticipating the Landing
- Going sideways in the flight, pulling into the landing position too high in the flight
#### Keeping the Free-Leg Flexed
- Allows over-rotation
#### “Pegging” the Landing
- Too tense
- Snapping underneath too early
#### Going into Landing Position too Late
#### Throwing the Torso Down
- Good landing position, but too early
- Increased FWD rotation, then the over-rotation wins out
