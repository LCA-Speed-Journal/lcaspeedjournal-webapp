[[Boo Shexnayder]] — LSU
- When body becomes acclimated to frequent use of low-to-moderate plyos, it helps tissue resilience —  Injury Prevention
- Plyos help reach corners of strength-development that traditional strength models can’t always hit
# Philosophy
- Jumps need to be responsive — don’t want super long GCT
- Think in Terms of Units — meant to be a main-course, not just a salt-and-pepper
	- Need standalone units, not just paired with weights
- Need to be Purposeful —  Always Quality over Quantity
- Load Progressively, then Maintain — Progression should Focus on Quality, not just increasing # of contacts in a week
# Categorizing
1. Lower-Leg Conditioning
2. In Place Jumps
3. Short Horizontal Bounds
4. Vertical Bounds
5. Hurdle Hops
6. Extended Bounds
7. Box and Depth Jumps

## Lower-Leg Conditioning
*Lower-Intensity, designed to progress into higher levels of training*
- Double-Leg Pogos, Split-Stance Pogos, Slalom Pogos, etc.
- 20-30s of work with a 1:1 to 2:1 Work-to-Rest Ratio
- 10-12 Total Sets
- Vary Surfaces, throw Barefoot in as Feasible
- Beware of Misapplication — Helps prevent things like S. Splints, but will exacerbate them if onset is already occurring
## In Place Jumps
*Primary way of establishing intitial volumes of moderate-intensity plyos*
- Skater-Jumps, 180’s, Tuck-Jumps at Medium-Amplitude, Star-Jumps, etc.
- 12-20s of work with a 1:2 Work-to-Rest Ratio
- 12-16 Total Sets
## Short Horizontal Bounds
*Primarily for developing horizontal skill development, accel, and COD.*
- Standing Long, Standing Triple, Bounding, Hopping, etc — all at moderate-intensity
- 4-6 Different exercises, 30-60 total takeoffs through the entire session
	- Limit to 5 Takeoffs per rep
## Vertical Bounds
*Primarily for Vertical Skill Development, Quality of Rebounding Contacts*
- SL Pogos with gradual progression N-S-E-W, etc. — Submax with a Vertical Emphasis
- 2-3 Repetitions of 6-8 Exercises
- 10-15m per repetition
## Hurdle Hops
*Getting athletes used to changing from static to elastic, vertical skill development, responsivity*
- Repeat Hops, Power-Hops (with walk to next hurdle), Repeat-Hops with pogos between, etc.
- Usually over 4-6 hurdles, 30-60 total Contacts p/session
## Extended Bounds
*Training for Sustained Force Production (can be good tool for 400/800m Runners as well)*
- Repeat Bounding for Distance, Prime-Times for Distance, Hopping/Bounding Sequences, etc.
- 2-3 Repetitions of 4-8 Exercises
- 20-40m per repetition, keep session volume <400m
## Box and Depth Jumps
*Higher levels of loading using added height (supramaximal), High-End Elastic STR-Development*
- 3-5 Repetitions of 4-5 Exercises
- Up to 40 Contacts p/session, <15 Contacts of High-End Work
- Keep it Simple — nothing complicated about the movement, it’s for the high-stimulus
- Individualize — Don’t just use a single set of boxes for all athletes of varying ability levels
# Ballistic Lifting
Light Load, Explosive Lifting (most common: Weighted Jumps)
- Enhance Absolute Strength
- Develop Elastic Strength
- Improve COD
## Periodizing Ballistic Lifts
- 3-5 Sets, 1-2x p/wk, 5-8 Reps p/set
- 10-30% of BW
- Constantly Change Exercises and Load — Great for In-Season, can sub in for Squats and Presses
# Program Design for Plyometrics
## Key Principles
- Maintain High Power-Output (last reps need to be just as good as first reps)
- Front-Load the Meso/Microcycles (more plyos in Week 1 than in Week 2-3, because athletes are fresher/bouncier)
- Need to Balance Vertical and Horizontal Work
	- We lean towards vertical, ofc, but need to work to keep horizontal included as a component
## Sequencing Guidelines
1. In-Place Jumps, Short Horizontal Bounds, Vertical Bounds — GPP Phase
2. Depth Jumps and/or Extending Bounds (with Review for overall Stimulation)
3. Opportunity, Reversion, and Hurdle Hops — In-Season Management
## General Preparation Phase
*Frequent, Moderate Doses*
- In-Place Jumps — if needed to establish initial volumes
- Short Horizontal Bounds — Horizontal Skill
- Vertical Bounds — Vertical Skill
## Specific Preparation Phase
*Less Frequent, alternating Stimuluating and Training Doses (High-Low)*
- Depth Jumps to Increase Load — Extended Bounds are a possible alternative
	- 1x p/wk Typically
- Stimulate between Sessions — Short Horizontal and Vertical Bounds
## In-Season Management
- Evaluate Training Readiness
- Aggregate Intensities Remaining High — can come from plyo-training, or sport-specific activity
- Subjective based on Competitive Schedule
	- (T&F Sprints/Jumps) just need to stimulate between meets once in competitive phase
- Common Strategies — Stimulation Only, or Microdosed Intensity
	- In a 17-day period of comp-phase, can usually find one day to get 20-30 quality contacts in
