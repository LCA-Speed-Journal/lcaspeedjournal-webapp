## Program Changes and Adaptations for Athlete Development
 Context:
 - Strength and Performance — [[Adam Vogel]] increased the volume of athletes coming through S&C, has procured a bunch of new equipment (has done grant-work to get a lot of it)
	 - 1x MaxV Day (Monday) — 
	 - 2x Strength Days (Wed, Fri) — 
- Returning Athletes — athletes who are good at many things being pulled in lots of directions, 
	- Programming need was to develop acceleration
## Past and Updated Training Structure for Sprints/Jumps
### Past: 
*all components trained regularly, but shifting the key focus block-to-block.*
- Blocks 1-2 (Weeks 1-8) — Fundamentals 
	- Acceleration — 4wks || MaxV — 4wks
- Block 3 (Weeks 9-11) — Spring Break + Reset
	- Peaking — 1wk || Reset — 1-2 weeks
- Blocks 4-5 (Weeks 12-18) — Building into Competition
	- Extending Speed — 4wks || Peaking — 3wks
### Changes:
- Strength/Acceleration — 8wks (!!!)
	- Resisted Sprints
	- Post-Practice Strength-Work
	- Post-Meet Strength-Work
### Long-Jump Case-Study: Training Shifts and Performance
2023 PR — 6.75m
- Put in a lot of work over the offseason, but couldn’t meet his PR the following indoor (-3cm)
	- Averaging higher, even if he couldn’t meet his all-time PR
- Builds momentum through outdoor, hitting big marks in the competition season
	- Was looking better — couldn’t pull it out at the State Meet / Nats
Structure coming into 2024 for this athlete:
- STR/Accel — 8wks || Peaking — 1wk || Reset — 2wks || Extending — 4wks || Peaking — 3wks
- Change in Emphasis — Sprint-Float-Sprints (In-and-Outs)
## Sprint-Float-Sprints: The Athleticism and Rhythm
- Teaching Sprinters to be Relaxed when Sprinting 
	- Build → Max → 90-95% → Max
- They’re Athletic — “A well-executed sprint-float-sprint is an elite expression of athleticism.”
	- Precision, knowing how to dial back while keeping controlled aggression
	- Rhythm, understanding the cadence of sprinting at top versus sub-max
- Accelerate — MaxV — Decay:
	- Trying to get up to the peak, back off a touch, then see what happens when ramping again
### Shifting Gears and Extending Sprint Distance
- Shifting Gears is a Skill — Planned Shifts (400 Pacing) vs Unplanned Shifts (get passed in 4x4)
	- Can you shift pace with poise?
	- Sprint-Float-Sprints allow you to practice a controlled changing of gears and let the athletes feel how things are to make those changes but keep good poise/posture
## In-Season Sprint Training for Better Outdoor Performance
Sprint-Float Sprint Ideal — 30m Build || 10m Sprint || 20m Float || 20m Sprint
- Need to build up to these distances (ideal rep ends up at 80m, that’s a ways to jump into)
- “If the first maxV window is much longer than the second, the second one suffers.” -[[Boo Shexnayder]]
### Progressing Fly-Sprints and Building Sprint Flow
- Start with Flying-Sprints (Fly-10s, Fly-20s)
- Prerequisite: Competition / Speed-Endurance
- Working Athletes towards Sprint-Float Sprints: 6 Key Sessions over 4 Weeks
	- Sprint – Float || 25-30m – 10m – 10m
	- Sprint – Float || 25-30m – 10m – 15m
	- Sprint – Float || 25-30m – 10m – 20m
	- Sprint – Float – Sprint || 25-30m – 10m – 20m – 10m
	- Sprint – Float – Sprint ||25-30m – 10m – 20m – 15m
	- Sprint – Float – Sprint || 25-30m – 10m – 20m – 20m
## Effective Sprint Cues and Techniques
### Sprint-Float-Sprint Cues
Build: Top-Speed by the *end* of the zone
- Do you Blast? Do you Bleed In?
Float: Keep things on Cruise-Control
- Arm-Action — need to relax them a little, release some tension
#### Applying this to Specific Athletes
Jumpers — the Float is “Runway Speed”
400 Guys — the Float is “Backstretch Speed”
### General Cues
- Jaw — space between the teeth, tongue on the roof of the mouth, talk
	- talking helps relax the jaw, can do as simple as reciting the ABC’s while in the fly-zone
- Shoulders — striking down
- RPR — getting athletes into a parasympathetic state
- Don’t over-cue too much on the form-side — athletes can get overloaded and lose focus
## Timing for the Sprint-Float-Sprint
- ~50% of athletes will actually be fastest in the approach
- Opens the conversation about what the athlete feels versus what the results are
### Rob’s Favorite for the Jumpers
- 1x Sprint-Float-Sprint
- Rest 8mins
- 1-3x LJ / TJ Approach
## Improving Jump Training with Tech and Communication
Misc Note — [[Dr. Tommy John]] and his Spinal Hygiene Routine
## Dynamic Interventions for Enhancing Jumps Training
### No 1080? Testing Asymmetries
- Unilateral Rebound Hops
- Low-Box Hops for Time
- Split-Squat ISO (using a crane-scale)
### Dynamic Interventions
- Hops (stationary and locomotive)
- Yielding “plyometrics” — nice mix betweeen weight-room and normal speed stuff
- Gallops
- Altitude Drops (split and unilateral)
- Asymmetric Attemps — bounds, skips, scissor hols
### Static Interventions
- RSIST Series 
	- (see [[Alex Natera]],  [[RSIST]], [[Complementing Speed-Development with RSIST]])
- Bilateral — Ground-Concept ([[Pat Davidson]])
### Misc Notes
- [[Ralph Mann]] — The Mechanics of Sprinting and Hurdling
	- Most elite HS-males match up with elite pro-females
- “Two athletes possessing the same abilities in everything but the start will end up with final times that are a full second apart.” -[[Ralph Mann]]
	- “It is difficult to believe that the start has the ability to affect such major performance changes, but this is the reality. An athlete that falls behind ihn the start will be playing ‘catch-up’ for the rest of the race.”
## Speed Development Methodology: Resistance and Circuits
- Resisted Sprints
- [[Tony Villani]] — Game-Speed Content
- Force — Velocity Performance Circuits
	- Max Force
	- Rapid Force
	- Unloaded or Loaded Sprint
	- Strength
- Go-To — Split-SQ OVC (3-5s Reps)
- Split-Squat Altitude-Drop
- kBox Hand-Supported Split-SQ
- Explosive-Dynamic ISO — OVC ISO, then Reps, repeated (5 Reps, 3 Reps, 1 Rep)
- DIY Henny (for Glute-Kickbacks)
	- $10 Hammock Straps, $20 Band-Pegs, and the $70 Henny Footplate
- Horizontal Projection with a Resisted Yuri (band or posterior-load)
- Power-Bounding
- ISO Mid-Thigh Pull
- Altitude-Drops (shallow)
- kBox RDL (staggered-stance)
- Flexed-Leg Bounds (bent-knee Primetimes)
