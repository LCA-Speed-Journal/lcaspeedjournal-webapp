# Elastic Essentials — Plyos Based on Timing, Fluidity, and Levers
## Introduction
Plyometrics — exercises that train the rebounding ability of the human body.
- Create an intense training stimulus for muscle, bones and connective tissues
- Train “same but different” relative to common explosive sport actions
- Dis-inhibit the neurological “brakes” on an athlete through specific overload
- Facilitate smoothness, rhythm and timing of movement in elastic situations
- Help athletes to feel and understand shifts in the foot lever system
Plyometrics generally are either “strength” oriented, or “elastic” oriented.
### “Strength” oriented plyometrics:
- Focus on strength of tissues and yielding
- Heavy “Class 1 Lever” usage
- Usually uses longer contact times, or a large range to stop motions
### “Elastic” Plyometrics:
- Focus on biomechanical optimization and reactivity
- Emphasizes a “Class 2 Lever” usage (or getting from a class 1 to class 2 lever quickly)
- Usually have shorter contact times, or short ranges to stop motions
- Plyometrics that continue motion (such as bounding)
We want to use an “inside out” system of looking at plyometrics, which prioritizes what type of
lever is being used in the plyometric (as well as the ground contact time). This is important when
looking at how to assign plyometric work in a training program, and understand what the goal of
the execution of the plyometric should look like. “Inside-out” prioritizes fast isometric contractions over larger, more drawn out movements.
### Levers
The levers we will look at in plyometrics include:
Class 1 Dominant (Heel)
- Characterized by “Strength”, pronation, and compression
Class 2 Dominant (Rigid Ball of Foot Action)
- These are not easy to train outside of smaller, vertically oriented movements, since big movements will make some use of the heel
Class 1 to 2 Emphasis (Transitioning to Ball of Foot Quickly)
- Characterized speed, a supination and expansion bias
## Spiraling Effects in Jumping
When jumping, generally, the legs work from external rotation, to internal (how far depends on
one’s alignment), back to external after the takeoff. This mechanism is very obvious in a:
- Standing vertical jump
- Single-leg jump off the run (prime example of need for expansion/supination)
This “external to internal to external” motion (see series below, on the left) represents the
spiraling action in jumping that is present in all dynamic human movement. 
The more force that needs to be utilized in shorter amounts of time (such as a single leg jump, see picture below, right) then the more the external rotation portion of the jump needs to be biased.
This is an important concept, since weight room movements, for example, usually make more use of compression and pronation to reverse a load’s direction, and represent a big gap that tends to exist between the weight room and dynamic sport movements (the other one being the velocity gap).
The powerful expansive strategy of an athlete to absorb massive forces in a foot contact, combined with good tensegrity running through the foot, can often result in the “turning” of shoes in jump plants, to the point where a substantial portion of the sole of the shoe comes off the ground! (see picture on the right).
## Class 1 Dominant Plyometrics
A ”Class 1 Dominant” would be a training exercise that spends an prolonged amount of time with the heel down on the ground.
Class 1 actions are not all bad! In some situations, athletes will naturally select a class 1 (prolonged heel) action over a class 2, such as when:
- An athlete is dropping downwards in the final steps of a jump
- An athlete needs more time to perform a given movement, such as in a hesitation move, or in various change of direction situations
- In various bounding situations, such as the step phase of a triple jump in track and field, or where an athlete is coming down from a jump landing and transitioning into a sprint
Class 1 dominant work can be good for building general strength qualities in the lower leg, but
plyometrics where an athlete is “class 1” should not represent the majority of exercises utilized.
Some class 1 lever work is fine, but it shouldn’t reflect too much of the program.
Some plyometric setups will create situations where athletes will tend to use their legs in a class
1 lever format, no matter how hard they try, which tend to be:
- Hurdle hops and depth jumping exercises with very vertical vectors (not much horizontal distance allowed for)
- Hurdle hops with very high hurdles (these will generally increase ground contact times and class 1 lever usage vs. short hurdles)
- Most single leg hurdle hops, unless the hurdles are very low
There are also some cases where an athlete who is very “stiff” and has a hard time dropping down into a jump can do well with intentional class 1 plyometrics with a greater level of knee bend.
This strategy can be complemented by the deep squatting progressions that can help expand the pelvic space downwards, from section 6.
## Class 2 Dominant Plyometrics
Class 2 dominant plyometrics are somewhat difficult to perform outside of small-ish vertical hops, since the induction of horizontal velocity, or large vertical motions (such as dropping straight down off a box) will induce the usage of the heel.
When it comes to training “straight class 2” usage of the lower leg, hopping in bent knee, or semi-squatted positions is required to really prioritize the balls of the feet.
As a general principle, smaller and faster plyometric ground contacts should make up the majority of a plyometric program (think smaller, quicker hops, hurdle hops, and bounding derivatives), while larger and more drawn out contacts (think of depth jumping exercises, or high hurdle hops) should play a smaller role.
## Class 1 to 2 Transition Plyometric Overview
The way that athletes transition from horizontal to vertical is the key factor when it comes to these “transition” plyometrics. Understanding the transition effect is important, since it tends to transcend the typical labels we create for plyometric exercise.
A good “class 1 to class 2” transition is one where an athlete utilizes the heel (heel hits, heel bone everts to create a pronation effect and stretch load) and then when the tibia is perpendicular to the ground, the athlete transitions powerfully to the ball of the foot (the class 2 lever). 
In this transition, the three arches of the feet must be “active”, or raised, for optimal effect.
Although there are some “class 1” lever situations in bounding, such as the track triple jump, basic bounding exercises can help train a class 1 to 2 transition on a rudimentary level (movements, such as “long to high”, will work this much more specifically and intensely than straight horizontal bounding).
## Class 1 to 2 Transition Plyometrics in Practice
In bounding, the key is to start with smaller movements, centered around what is happening between the foot and the ground. Work from “small” to “big” over time, and let knee height happen naturally (you will see a resonance here, and in sprinting, as seen in the next section).
One interesting phenomenon is that the lower the knee action, the more one can generally feel the lower leg working in a movement. Bounding far with an intentional low-knee action is one of the most high-intensity exercises one can perform for the lower legs, and should only be performed by mature individuals, adept at bounding after an extensive warmup process.
More so than regular bounding, ideal class 1 to 2 transition plyometrics are those that generally
work off of long to high wave-forms. They focus on a quick and powerful transition from the heel (left frame below), to the heel leaving the ground when the shin moves towards a perpendicular position, (middle and right frames). “Long to high” is what truly sets up any explosive running vertical jump, as well as many other athletic skills.
I have found that single leg versions of “class 1 to class 2” style work are much superior to trying
to do much double leg work in a “long to high” format, simply because a true double leg “long
to high” motion in sport rarely occurs, and tends to feel awkward. Regardless, some basic single
response drills, like a long jump to a box jump, or a depth drop to a long jump can also train the
class 1 to 2 mechanism effectively.
## Rhythmic Plyometrics and Heel Taps
Heel taps, as discussed in section 2, can be a useful tool for rapidly activating the muscles that create stability in the ankle. They also can be used in conjunction with various athletic skills, or relevant sport skill positions (picture on the right) to help athletes learn more about the inherent timing of the lower leg in those movements.
Rhythmic plyometrics are a powerful training tool that combines small rhythmic “bounces” with maximal jumps. An example would be doing 3 bounces in a lunge position, and then doing a high split squat jump out of the bottom on the 4th jump, repeating this sequence several times.
I like to use “rhythmics” early on in a training program to help athletes prioritize small elastic motions, versus being biased only towards large magnitude options. When a program reaches a
place where more intensity is warranted, then I will generally transition to a higher proportion of
large-magnitude explosive work. These rhythmic exercises also reduce compensation patterns, and help for more fluid movement, in my experience.

> [!NOTE] A Note on Depth Jumps and Altitude Drops
One popular training element I didn’t cover a whole lot in the plyometric course was depth
jumping and altitude drops. 
These are some of the most “powerful” plyometric exercises, and have effects that are similar to doing heavy partial squats, in the sense that, they stimulate the body strongly to become more powerful, but they also “cost” a lot of nervous system energy.
Use too many depth jumps and drops and eventually you will hit a wall, or over-train.
This being said, I enjoy using drops fairly regularly throughout the training year, but in very small
doses. In a way, drops are the “fastest” plyometric, because stopping the drop “on a dime” causes the energy to re-enter the body faster than other jumping methods. 
Depth jumps are the “nitro”, and can be used in short 2-4 week spurts several times per year.

At the end of the day, biomechanics should be at the core of a plyometric program, and the depth
jumps and drops are a little more general in nature (and often times, class 1 oriented) but they
are very powerful stimulators of the entire body.
