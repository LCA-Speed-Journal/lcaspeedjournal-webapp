# Jumps

Jump event (high jump, long jump, triple jump) programming and technique materials

## Programming

- [[+Elastic Essentials]]: [[Joel Smith]] MOC organizing elastic training resources covering the need for elastic training, training the feet for reactive power, bodyweight training basics, and plyometrics based on timing, fluidity, and levers with emphasis on foot and lower leg as foundation for speed and power.
- [[+High-Jump 101]]: MOC outlining fundamental concepts and training for high jump, covering approach, takeoff, bar clearance, and landing, with an emphasis on rhythm and coordination.
- [[+Jump 101 Training]]: MOC organizing [[Keinan Briggs]]' Jump 101 training system with links to Long-Jump 101 and Triple Jump 101 content.
- [[+Long-Jump 101]]: MOC organizing [[Keinan Briggs]]' Long Jump 101 content covering mentality, concepts, training approaches, and workouts for the long jump.
- [[+Triple Jump 101]]: MOC organizing [[Keinan Briggs]]' Triple Jump 101 content covering triple jump concepts, fixing chronic foulers, training drills, and training programs.
- [[2024 Changes to the HF Jumps Group]]: [[Rob Assisse]] (Homewood Flossmoor) document detailing changes to the jumps program for 2024, including extended strength/acceleration block (8 weeks), sprint-float-sprint emphasis for athleticism and rhythm, and training structure shifts with case study of long jumper performance progression.
- [[Plyometric Periodization and Classification]]: [[Boo Shexnayder]] (LSU) plyometric categorization and periodization system covering philosophy (responsive jumps, purposeful quality), categories (lower-leg conditioning, in-place jumps, short horizontal bounds, vertical bounds, hurdle hops, extended bounds, depth jumps), with volume and phase recommendations.

## Technique

- [[Field-Work with Boo Shexnayder]]: [[Boo Shexnayder]] field-work session covering four issues (pathological gait problems, global factors, self-organizing skills, things you have to teach), stance on 2-point start, building towards upright running, and coaching distribution of acceleration with emphasis on patient cadence increase.
- [[Jumps101 — Concepts of the Long Jump]]: [[Keinan Briggs]] long jump concepts covering approach measurement and structure (6-step, 10-step, 14-step, 18-step approaches with drive, acceleration, and top-end phases), sweet spot considerations, long-jump entry mechanics (big split, attacking down, staying stacked), riding the board, and flight patterns (hang, hitch).
- [[Jumps101 — Fixing Chronic Foulers in the Triple Jump]]: Brief guide to fixing chronic foulers by addressing anticipation of takeoff, using cones at 2 strides from board to force athletes to sprint through cone and only think about takeoff in last few strides.
- [[Jumps101 — Mentality]]: [[Keinan Briggs]] mental approach covering goal setting (long-term and short-term), training gear (offseason vs in-season), LEAP philosophy (Develop, Training, Compete), training cycles, weight training vs functional training considerations, and key elements (hip-girdle, soleus, adductors, abductors, back, glutes).
- [[Jumps101 — Training Drills for Triple Jump]]: [[Keinan Briggs]] triple jump training drills including bounding, combo bounding (hop-bounds), hop progression drills (standing touch, takeoff projection, hop-recovery, arm drive to takeoff, jogging touch, advanced hop drilling), step phase development (step to jump), jump phase development, and additional drills.
- [[Jumps101 — Training for the Long Jump]]: [[Keinan Briggs]] long jump training covering bounding (developing power, timing, patience, elasticity), and specific drills (dribble runs, dribble runs to pop-up, rocket lunges, gallops, hurdle-hops, jump to bungee).
- [[Jumps101 — Training Program for Triple Jump]]: [[Keinan Briggs]] triple jump training program structure with warmup, cycle 1 (base-training), cycle 2 (functional-training), and cycle 3 (competition training) including jump practice, speed work, and plyos with detailed drill progressions for hop, step, and jump phases.
- [[Jumps101 — Triple Jump Concepts]]: [[Keinan Briggs]] triple jump concepts covering approach distance recommendations, double arm vs single arm entry techniques, triple entry and posture (Figure-4, big-split, downward-attack), hop phase checkpoints (pogo vs extension, drop-leg mechanics), step phase checkpoints (using step like a bound), and jump phase checkpoints.
- [[Jumps101 — Workouts for the Long Jump]]: [[Keinan Briggs]]' long jump workout programming including warmup (stolen from [[Dan Pfaff]]), training cycles (base-training, functional-training, competition training) with specific day structures, plyos, tempo running, and jump practice progressions.
- [[Long-Jump Technique]]: [[Bob Thurnhoffer]] (University of Louisville) comprehensive long jump technique covering approach (vision at start, consistent start, uniform acceleration, up to 90-95% maxV), postural alignment, amplitude of movement, penult and takeoff mechanics, flight patterns, and landing techniques.
- [[Seminar_Training for Triple-Jump]]: [[Maria Creech]] (Colorado State) triple jump training seminar emphasizing first phase is key (especially entry into first phase), starting small with step-overs, SL hopping, bounding, box-phases, and progressing to short approach full-phase work, with frequency recommendations (bounding all the time, full-phase jumps 1x p/wk, 3-4 reps p/session).
