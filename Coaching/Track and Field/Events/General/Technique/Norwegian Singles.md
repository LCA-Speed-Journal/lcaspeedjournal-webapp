# The Gist
The main hypothesis behind this method is that you can accumulate significantly more training stress (measured by pace-based TSS) over a given period of time vs. a traditional Daniels approach (track workout, tempo, long run), with the same or less fatigue / injury risk. 
	The key is to always err on the slower side and not go over your LT threshold (even when feeling good) as that leads to disproportionate fatigue for the training stress, and can very quickly build up and leave you trashed.
If you just think of the Norwegian System as emphasizing threshold workouts then whether you use the first template or the second, you're training using the Norwegian System. 
What gives the Norwegian System its novelty is 
 1) The regular utilization of lactate values (or efforts) that are lower than the traditional LT as popularized by Daniels and others
 2) The redundancy in the workouts used. This even goes against some coaches suggestions on never repeating the same workout or always progressing the workout so as to modulate the training load. 
> [!NOTE] A Note from The Author
Consistency over many weeks, say 18-24, and then just repeated for each build-up is **better** than the really intense workouts that are progressed toward at the end of most runners' training plans in order to illicit a big stimulus and "peak" them.

> [!NOTE] Sub-threshold is a STATE, not a pace.
> For trained runners, if LT2 threshold is 4.0-4.5mmol, a sub-threshold session should aim to reach ~2.5-3.5mmol measured at the end of the last rep.
# The Training
Build towards 2-3 sub-threshold sessions per week + 1 long run, and the rest easy. 
	Sub-threshold work should comprise 20-25% (MAYBE 30%) of total time spent running during the week. 

> [!NOTE] Sample Weekly Schedules
> Typical weeks look like
> 	a) E [easy run], Q, E, Q, E, Q, LR 
> 	b) Rest, Q, E, Q, E, Q, LR.
> 	Key: (Q = quality, i.e., sub-threshold).

Reaching sub-threshold can be done with a virtually unlimited combination of interval distances, paces, and rest periods. 
### Distance-Based Intervals
-  400m reps (if math is right, 15-20 x 400m)
	- 30" rest —  10K pace
- 1k reps (usually 8-12 x 1k) 
	- 60" rest — 10mi to 15K pace
- 2k reps (usually 4-6 x 2k)
	- 60" rest — HM pace
- 3k reps (usually 3 x 3k)
	- 60" rest — 30K pace
### Time-Based Intervals
- 1 minute reps (if math is right, 15-20 x 60s)
	- 30" rest — 10K pace
- 3-4 minute reps (in line with 8-12 x 3-4min)
	- with 60" rest — 10mi to 15K pace
- 6-8 minute reps (in line with 4-6 x 6-8min)
	- with 60" rest — HM pace
- 10-12 minute reps (in line with 3 x 10-12min)
	- with 60" rest — 30K pace 

Rest can be standing, walking, or jogging. Goal is to just keep the rest short to maintain lactate state.
## Easy-Runs
On easy runs, keep them extremely EASY. 
Absolutely no higher than 65% of MAS (your max pace you can hold for 6 minutes) or 70% of max heart rate.
# Modifications
Nothing here is original, all structures that plenty of coaches and runners have used before. 
Coaches like Tinman, [[Joe Rubio]], Wetmore, Hudson use a pretty standard outline as follows:
- Mon - Workout
- Tue - Medium Long Run
- Wed - Easy w/ strides
- Thu - Workout
- Fri - Easy
- Sat - Long Run
- Sun - Easy w/ strides
If that's a structure that appeals to you, you can use that template and just make both your workouts threshold sessions. If you're wanting to follow the "Norwegian" outline:
- Mon - Tempo
- Tue - Easy
- Wed - Tempo
- Thu - Easy
- Fri- Repetitions
- Sat - Long Run
- Sun - Easy
If in your warm up for the two tempo sessions you do 8x100m strides, that's two sessions of strides there. 
The repetition workout is essentially a stride workout, so far as pace goes (assuming it is done at approximately 1500m pace) although if the repetitions are longer and/or the total volume is high, the physiological impact can be different than a basic leg speed session.
