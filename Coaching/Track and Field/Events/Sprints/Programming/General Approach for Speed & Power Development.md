## Starting with a Needs Analysis
- Every Sport is Different
	- Comp Schedule, Position/Event
	- Kinematics — running, jumping, throwing, etc
	- Kinetics — peak-force, RFD, ECC-RFD, impulse, GCT, peak-power output, etc
	- Common Injuries
- Aerobic vs Anaerobic Components
	- Aerobic — HR (Avg and Max), Total Distance Covered p/game or event
	- Anaerobic — sprint volume, COD, accels/decels
## Power Development
- Sprinting, Jumping, Throwing — The General Basics
- Power-Oriented Lifting — Olympic Lifts
	- Power → Hang → Floor — can also do from blocks
	- Pull → High-Pull → Muscle-Clean → Clean
