# Critical Factors in Speed Development

## Boo’s Philosophy on Speed Development
- Speed can’t develop in a vacuum
	- If all you’re interested in is the speed workouts, you’re not setting yourself up well
- Most important thing: Prioritize it to Get Better at it
	- Need to focus the effort on what you want to develop — [[Keep the Main Thing the Main Thing]]
	- Organize everything else *around* your priority — [[Don’t Chase Two Rabbits]]
- Sometimes, mechanics are tied to pathology — needs to be trained out, not cued out
	- (feels connected to a [[Constraint-Driven Model]] of coaching)
- It’s a CNS problem — two kids with identical structure and musculature can be vastly different
### Boiling it Down
1. To stimulate the CNS, it needs to be high-intensity (near-maximal) — applies to plyos and weights too. Not about how much you do, it’s about how intense you do it
2. Understand the Value of High-Rest (facilitate high outputs by being fresh — [[Tony Holler]] motto)
3. Understand the Value of Low-Volume (quality over quantity) — it’s about How Well You Do It. 
	1. Better Off Doing Less at High-Quality, versus More At Mid-to-Low-Quality
## The Relationship Between Speed and Strength
Speed is connected to the strength as a multiplier
	get faster, have higher ability to use CNS → have higher ability to activate muscle tissue, drive strength up
Work things that are Compatible in the Same Workout — Group things by Neural Demand
-  Speed Training, Plyos, Olys, and Major Lifts go together
- Bodyweight, “fitness,” and lower-intensity things go together
## Aerobic and Lactate
High-Lactate stuns the CNS, diminishes its effects (it’s a neuromuscular irritant) — can’t pair it with Speed the next day.
	Surgical use of Lactic-work — strike where needed, but never too much
That being said, developing mild-to-moderate Lactate levels actually improves the response to Speed/Power
	This much you can do all the time, helps them to restore/recover as well
Boo never does Aerobic in isolation for the sprinters/power-athletes — not a two-way street (anaerobic helps aerobic, but not the other way around)
	“Never training them under 70%”
## Training for Acceleration
- 40m or Less to train the Accelerative Capability
- Can get away with incomplete recovery, but still need to be more than 90% recovered
	- Reinforces that mild-to-moderate lactate theory, adds an anabolic effect to the work
## Training for Top-End
- Athletes can hold top-speed for at most 3sec. 
	- Usually between 40-70m.
- 60m is a great drill for overall development 
	Lets them accelerate, hold MaxV for a couple seconds, then cut the rep before things start to deteriorate
- Boo likes to dop Sprint-Float-Sprints
### Stretch-Shortening
- Drive Up harder, get SSC back into ground harder — and vice-versa
### Adjustments Need to be Made
- “If you want to be a good coach, you need to be a cone-kicker”
	- Younger atheltes hit maxV earlier, need to shift zones earlier, and vice-versa for elites.
	- Be prepared to adjust for individuality — the magic isn’t in the length, it’s in the stimulus
## Speed Endurance
- Not really about endurance, it’s about developing higher levels of specific coordination
	- When things get faster, we make small motor mistakes 
	- more encoded muscle-memory helps smooth this over — speed endurance helps this
## Training Readiness
- Move from Short-to-Long across the season (sensical, pretty well established)
	- Allows for early-season to also delay the inclusion of Speed Endurance
	- “too many speed programs get ruined by doing speed-endurance right out of the box”
## Weight-Training
Olypmic Lifting enhances transfer, but *heavy* strength-training tends to reverse the effects
- Don’t do Heavy-Lifting and then Speed the next day
- Can pair Heavy-Lifting with Speed on the same day (just do speed first)
## Season Periodization
Phase 1 = Power-Development
Phase 2 = Quality-Development (enhancing intensity of plyos, olys, adding more heavy lifting, etc.)
In-Season 
### Boo’s Weekly Model
- Monday is a Power-Day (Explosive)
- Later in the Week is Speed Development (“best training”) — Wednesday, Thursday, maybe even Friday
	- Connects to [[Racehorse 2]] model — Capacity-Friday, Accel-Monday, Speed-Wednesday
