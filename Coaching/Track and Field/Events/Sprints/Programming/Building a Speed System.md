# *You Can’t Teach Speed…*
says every coach who things 16 x 110yd is “Speed Work.”
	A lot of medium-intensity work, not a lot of speed-specific stuff
## Dynamic Correspondence Theory
[[Yuri Verkhoshansky]] coined the term **Dynamic Correspondence** in early 90s.
- Same Muscle Groups Involved
- Same ROM and Direction of Movement
- Same Type of Muscle-Contraction
- Accentuated Regions of Force Production
- Magnitude of Force, and Duration Applied
(seems related to [[Dimensions of the CNS]])
To create direct adaptation, you need to be hitting nearly all the categories: if 3-4
	i.e. you need to sprint to get faster at sprinting.
# Transfer
Can teach speed, just need to make sure it’s specific with adequate rest.
	From there, need tech adaptations to also keep improving.
Develop Tech for High-Speed Sprinting — Train at, around, or above MaxV — Test and Record Changes to MaxV
### Specific Things that have some sense of Transfer
- 0-5m: 
	- Resisted Sprints, 
	- Explosive Jumps, 
	- Olys, and 
	- Strength-Work 
	- (MB Throws and Plyos have medium)
- 5-10m: 
	- Resisted Sprinting, 
	- Plyos, 
	- Explosive Jumps 
	- (MB Throws and Olys have medium)
- 10-20m: 
	- Resisted Sprinting, 
	- Plyos 
	- (MB Throws, Explosive Jumps have medium)
- 20-30m: 
	- Plyos 
	- (MB Throws have medium, Resisted and Explosive Jumps have low)
- 30-40m: 
	- Plyos (medium)
# No Time?
Implementing minimal effective dose for speed isn’t as much as you think.
	can be achieved in short time frames (5-15min) as part of a warmup.
Physical, Technical, Stimulus
## Training Residuals — If you Don’t Use, you’ll lose.
Maximal Speed declines at 5-7 days. Aerobic can have lasting effects for 30+ days.
	If you don’t sprint weekly: motor control, neuromuscular, and PCr storage all diminish — increase injury-risk
# Don’t We Get Enough in Practice?
Increase of hamstring-activation is an exponential effect on the hamstring — 75% won’t cut it, because even just going from 85-90% is a change.
	Need to be **max-effort.** Regularly.
Estimated 85% at 10yd, 90% at 15, 94% at 20yd

# *It’s Too Risky to Train Speed*
It’s the opposite. Too risky to not train, esp. if you have fast athletes.
	Dose is the poison — high risk vs vaccine.
That being said, don’t volume-spike, don’t intensity-spike. You’re in the danger zone on either size of the optimal training load.
## Reccomendations from Les: the “Sprinting Vaccine”
1. Sprint >95% 1x p/wk
2. Build chronic training load of 85% or higher
3. Do thorough warmup and hit high-speed while fresh
4. Rest Maximally between intense efforts
5. Increase volume by bno more than 5-10% p/wk
6. Sweet spot for reps >85% is 5-8 p/wk
7. Sweet spot for reps >95% is 1-5 p/wk
# Research Article
Mendiguchia et al. (Jonas Dodoo was also on the study)
	Holistic program working on speed-tech drills, rehab, and gym-based movements over a six-week period. Led to +0.44 m/s after the intervention, over the control group

![[Characteristics of Speed]]
# Metrics of Speed
## Lv. 1: MaxV Benchmarking — Lv. 2: Accel Profiling
Test → Monitor Changes → Compare to Benchmarks
	→ ID Strengths, Weaknesses → Outcome, Drivers, Strategies → Individualize the Program, Train
Outcomes: Max-Speed, Horizontal Power
Drivers: Power, STR, ROM, Reactivity
Strategy: Sprint-ROM, Frontside-Range, Thigh AngularV, Ground-Speed, TouchdownV, Vertical Stiffness
## Lv. 3: Physical Profiling
## Lv. 4: Technical / Stride-Parameters
## Lv. 5: IRA

![[(CSAC-5) Programming Speed & Agility#Program Design (see (CSAC-5) Programming Speed & Agility CSAC-5 )]]
# Drill Selection
- Vertical Drills – A-series, switches, etc – General
- Horizontal Drills – band-drills, wall-marches, etc. teaching posture – Shoulder
- Projection Drills – teaching max-extension, projecting shoulder – Shoulder
- Resisted Accels – Waist
- Unresisted Accels – Specific
## MaxV Drills
- Overhead Drills
- Dribbles
- Wickets
- Fly-Sprints
- Sprints
# Injury Risk Mitigation
## Assessment
- ROM — Range, Asymmetry. Low-Range is red-flag
- Lumbo-Pelvic Control — Kickback Score, Asymmetry, Low-Score is red-flag
> [!INFO]- Kickback Profile:
![[Pasted image 20250915110438.png]]
- Lumbo-Pelvic (continued)
	- Basic Control — Pelvic Control Drills (tilting)
	- Static-ISOs — Hollow-Body, Deadbug, Plansk, Side-Planks
	- Dynamic-ISOs — Overhead Step-Ups, Overhead A-Series, Stir-the-Pot, Split-SQ
	- Comp-Movements (like Sprinting)
- Sprint-Work — FVP, Force-Imbalance, Low-Force is red-flag

## Intervention
Add extra mobility if red-flags, but all athletes take care to do preventative measures.
### Strength-Exposures (for all athletes):
Hip:
- 0-60° — Extended, Accel
	- Hip-Thrust / Glute Bridge / Back Ext.
- 60-90° — Mid-Range, Accel / MaxV
	- Deadlift / High Step-Up / High Sled-Push
- 90-110° — Deep, MaxV / Accel
	- Split-SQ / Low Sled-Push / RDL
Hamstring:
- Hip over Knee — > Angular-Velocity with downward movement of the foot
	- RDL
- Knee over Hip — Prevent Knee-Extension in the Swing-Phase
	- Nordic
- Stiffness at Knee/Hip — ISO-Strength at Touchdown
	- “Tantrums”
# Q&A Period
## Dealing with Online-Clients: how to Adjust Training?
Polls the Wellness metrics (via survey) ~60mins after waking up.
Key: Change by coach, but trust athlete agency to self-regulate a lot more
