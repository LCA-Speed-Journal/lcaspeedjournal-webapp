# Speed Strength
### (Ch 1) Intro
General Pyramid: Max Strength → Rapid Strength → Repeated Strength
### (Ch 2) Glutes
- Glute-Max Produced more Activity @ 80-90% than at 1RM, during the ascending phase of the squat
	- Highest EMG Activation during Step-Ups
	- 2nd Place: Hip-Thrust, followed closely by Split-Squat
- Variations (in order of GM Activation): 
	- Step-Up
	- Lateral Step-Up
	- Diagonal Step-Up
	- Crossover Step-Up
	- Hex-Bar Dead (has more than H. Thrust)
	- H. Thrust Variations
- Glute Med: Split-Squats
	- BW Alternatives: Side-Lying Hip Abduction
- Glute Min: Hip-Hikes (ISO Holds for >15s)
### (Ch 3) Hams
- Bi. Femoris: Nordics with Dorsi-Flex
	- Followed by BB Dead, Ball Heel Strike, and then Hip-Thrust
- Semimembranosis: Lying Leg Kick
	- Followed by Nordics & Cranes
	- Lying Leg Kick How-To: Lying supine, shoulders/hips/R Heel on ground
		- Kick L Heel up, to lift R foot off ground
		- Land on R Foot again, then repeat for reps
- [[Semitendinosis]]: SL Leg Curl
### (Ch 4) Calves
- Gastroc contributes to pushing upwards and forwards — highest muscle activation during all-foot contact
- Soleus contributes mainly to absorb forces upon ground contact — force peak @ approx. midstance
- Most calf work isolates Gastroc, so we need to work more bent-leg work
	- Pogos, Depth Jumps, Standing Calf doesn’t do much for soleus
- Turn-Out stimulates medial gastroc, toe-in stimulates lateral gastroc
### (Ch 5) Achilles
- Best thing for Achilles: Eccentric Training (good for tendinopathy and injury prevention)
- Slow multijoint to dynamic single-leg incrementally increase Achill loading
- More Loading: CM Jumps, SL Movements, Drop-Jumps, Hopping
### (Ch 6) Quads
- Vast. Med: 80% 1RM in both ECC and CON phases of squat
	- Spanish Squats beat BW and Wall SQ for both Rec Fem, VL, and VM — Greatest activation with 90° trunk angle
