# Pure Speed
### Intro
General Principles — High-Quality, Low-Quantity, Max-Effort, Long Rest Times
#### Things that Dilute Speed:
- “Dilute” to diminish the strength - Webster
- Doing weird drills you saw online w/o knowing what they’re for
- Tons of volume: instead of speed, doing cardio
- Resting little: each sprint ends up slower, and lower quality
### Law 1: Rest
Generally, 1.5min p/10m (this is the low-end, resting longer can be better)
### Law 2: Frequency
Generally, 48-72hrs between session (or 2x p/wk if following a conventional schedule)
- More is not always better: Running Slow will Train you To Run Slow
### Law 3: Volume
Again, Quality over Quantity
Diminishing Returns — Sprint enough to Develop Speed, Don’t Sprint so much that Body Fatigues
Counter-Arguments: Still Training Mechanics, Sprinting STR, Tendons, etc.
- Yes, but. Not pure speed anymore.
### Law 4: Prioritization
Hit speed @ Beginning of Week — Before STR, Before Practice, Before anything that will fatigue
#### Mistakes:
- STR Training morning before (or day before) Sprint Session
- Intense Practice Morning/Day Before
- Intense Comp morning/day before
### Law 5: Distances
- Aim in the 40-120m range for most speed reps
- Need to get nearish to 60m to develop maxV
- Consider the event. Team sports is very short (5-15yd sprints)
- Above 20m develop maxV “for sports”
### Law 6: 45/90
- Referring to the amount of time to warmup. 45min is a good idea.
- Multi-Event Considerations: Be Creative with the Warmup — Ex: light practice in morning, immediate buildup to 40m, 3-4 high-quality 40m
	- Better than those sprinting max-effort 3x p/wk
#### Warmup Breakdown: 45mins total
- Jog — 5min
- Dynamic Stretching — 10min
- Specific Drills — 10min
- Plyos — 5min
- Stride-Outs — 10min 
- Rest — 5min
### Law 7: Max-Out
You might not always have a PB, but you wanna try your best within every session if you’re training for speed
#### Killers for Max-Out potential:
- Minimize Distractions, Maximize things that excite you
- Sleep, Warmup, Training Solo vs Partner, Bad/Good Weather, Partner’s Attitude
- Don’t Do List: make a list of things that will benefit your performance by NOT doing
	- “Won’t check messages before an intense session”
	- “Won’t use Phone in Bed”
	- “Won’t eat junk food, esp. The day/morning of training”
- To-Do List;
	- “Eat 2hrs Before, so somach isn’t full but is fueled”
	- “Will charge headphones”
	- “Will review workout ahead of time”
	- “Pack bag ahead of time”
	- “Train when I have the most energy”
### Law 8: Longevity
- The Longer you’re healthy, the more you can Improve — Longer you’re injured? Less time to improve.
- The same stuff that helps you run faster also helps minimize risk of injury
- Injuries happen more often when you break the laws of pure speed
- Usually “The Big 4”
	- Short Rest
	- Poor Quality Reps
	- Little to No Warmup
	- Too Much Volume
