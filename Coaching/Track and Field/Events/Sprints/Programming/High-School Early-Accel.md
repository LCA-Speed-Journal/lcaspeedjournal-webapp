## Warmups: ~15mins
Les calling out drills, had 3 heats of 5-6 across — 10-20yd of drill, finish with jog to line.
	Just “Go — Go — Go” for the commands, left most of the agency to the athletes
	Used colored cones as markers for distance, difference was a color-callout
Active mobility intermingled with actual drills (high-knee pulls, lateral carioca, pogos, etc.)
#### Notable Pieces
- Pogo Series: 5yd p/ea
	- N-S-E-W, did bilateral and then unilateral
- Short Accels (5yd) with varied start-triggers: Fast Feet x2, Lateral Line-Hop x2
- After short-accels, did a longer (20yd into 15yd decel) still at 90%
- Did band-activation *after* the short-accels
- Minor tweaks based on athlete experience
	- high-flexion was hands-on-hips for newbies, arm-drive for vets
- High Knee Lift + 1s Hold (hands-on-hips)
	- Warming up, but also conditioning hip-flexors/psoas
- Called “Demo” when athletes should demonstrate the tech on their own
	- Short, just a couple reps (switches, for example) — allowed for more precise coach correction
- Lot of time on Switching: ~10yd p/ea
	- Marches, Singles, Bounce-and-Switch, Triple-Switch — all with Hands-on-Hips
## First Steps: Short Accels
#### 2pt Stance: 2-Steps
Coach-Cue: “setup the torso where we want it on step one. From there, explode straight out and attack back”
	3 Reps, 5 lines: watching for big themes, but mostly just letting the athletes think about the reps
	***“What was our goal?”*** — Call-and-Response, making sure they’re focusing by recalling the cues
After regroup, adding another cue — gradual torso rise
	Another 3-4 Reps, then recalling group to change
#### Half-Kneel 2-Steps: 3-4 Reps
Thinking about loading and pressing, rather than just stepping out
#### 30yds All-Out: 4 Reps
