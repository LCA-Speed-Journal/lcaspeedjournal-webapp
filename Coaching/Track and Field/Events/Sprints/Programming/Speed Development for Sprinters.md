# Speed Development for Sprinters

## Components of Speed Development
- Accel, MaxV
- Momentum
- Posture – Joint Stabilization and Stretch-Shortening
---
## Speed Development: Accel
- Postural Establishment — better Posture in Accel makes it easier to hit better Posture in MaxV
	- Want to create “straight lines” — easier to hammer the nail if you’re angled correctly
	- Trap — “can’t hold good posture because they aren’t strong enough.” Ab training isn’t going to magically fix the problem in most athletes
- Momentum Development Phase
- Traditional Definition: 0-40m
### Characteristics:
- Frequency is slower, quickens throughout
- COM starts further in front, with foot contact slightly in front, and toe-off behind
- Each step is both forwards and upwards
	- Looking for the spine and the shin to match angles
### Common Errors:
- Not progressing upward with each step
- Trying to “stay low”
- Improper frequency development
---
## Developing Acceleration
### Protocols
- Establish Proper Start Positions — Standing, crouch, 3pt, 4pt, blocks
- Slow down the reccomendations
- Recovery *can* be incomplete
### Training
- Up to 300m p/session (don’t need to go that high, can do less)
- Break reps out into 15-40m — 3x (20, 30, 40), 3x20 + 3x30 + 3x40, etc.
---
## Speed Development: MaxV
- Postural Maintenance
- Traditional View is from (30-40m) - (60-70m) — 30-40m zone in the middle of the race
### Characteristics:
- Fastest possible movement of the body
- Fast, intense, but with relaxation
	- Looking to maintain that element of relaxation even in the practices — cue this when doing drills, etc.
- High-Frequency
- Touchdown just barely in front of OCM
- Toe-Off just barely behind
- Upright running
- Force is *downward*
### Common Errors
- Not enough momentum from the accel phase
	- If we don’t have it, we want to “try and get it” by being overly aggressive and minimizing relaxation
- Not working in the vertical
	- Don’t want to think about grabbing the track, think about driving down and through
- Poor posture (brought on by bad accel-phase)
	- Bad posture means it’s a lot harder for the joints to stabilize — can’t effectively use that ISO-strength when we impact the ground
	- Bad posture can visually be seen in bigger backside (pelvis tipped)
	- Athletes who feel too far forward will try to strike earlier (reaching down with forefoot), which minimizes the spring and the natural return from the foot.
	- Hard to out-cue this, because it’s unconscious when the athlete feels imbalanced
- Reaching for stride-length
	- longer length is caused by imparting more force into the ground and “getting more bounce out of it”

## Training for Speed Development (MaxV)
### Fly-In Runs
- 25-40m accel-zone — building strong momentum into the zone, aggressive
- 10-30m Fly — Upright, Tall, Striking Firm
- Manipulating the Fly-Zone — early in the year, maybe only a 10, 15, then working up later on
- Establish Start Position — 
- Reminding of Slow-Down Distribution — distribute the accel properly so you’re relaxed enough in the zone to actually sit in those MaxV mechanics.
- Slow-Down zone of 15-30m
### Ins & Outs
- 25m accel-zone
- 30m total-zone, broken into 2-halves — Hit and Relax
	- 10-20
	- 15-15
	- 20-10
- Number of Ins
	- 2 or 3
- Example — 85m Rep-Length
	- 25m accel → 20m hit → 10m relax → 20m hit → 10m relax
- Not a huge difference visually, should stay with good posture, good mechanics
	- Will likely hear an auditory difference in the aggressiveness of the hits
### Sprint-Float
- 50m accel — Sprint Zone, accelerating hard
- 20m float — like the relax-zones of the Ins & Outs, should be upright and quality
- 20m sprint — re-applying the aggression
### Protocols
- Establish Start Positions
- Slow-Down Reccomendations
- Recovery is FULL on each rep (4-6mins)
### Training
- 300-500m p/session
	- 3x20m Accel + 2-4 ins/outs of 90m
	- 3x20m Accel + 3-5 Flys with 25m Zone
	- 3x20m Accel + 2-3 Sprint-Float-Sprints of 90m

## Programming throughout the Year
- Accel — doing from Day 1
- General Prep — Heavy Emphasis
- Working the Accel, then extending it
- When in Specific Prep — begin to bring in some speed development
	- Extending the maxV zones throughout
- When in Pre-Comp & Comp — similar to Specific Prep
## Reminders
- Speed Development is always intense
- Pairing Intense Activities Together — plyos, heavy weights
- Coach EVERYTHING
	- Warmup to Cooldown
	- Cues should be short and simple — build a common library
	- Don’t be afraid to stop
	- Don’t be afraid to amend — different event groups might have different capacities
## Q&A Period
### Addressing/Assessing Mobility/Stability Issues
- in the Warmup, always looking for things like dynamic flexibility, hurdle drills, etc.
- More pathological issues, can hit things more from targeted work on in the weightroom
### Meet Timing: What about a Wednesday Meet?
Maybe it’s the prior friday, etc. Look back over 10 days, don’t just try to cram into Mon/Tue
### Training Activities after hitting Speed
- if you’re going to run, need to keep intensity lower (less then 75%) — easy 100s, tempo-work, 
- circuit-work (bodyweight things are great)
- DON’T follow it with Speed Endurance if you’re in comp (I mean, yeah, duh), but if still in Sp. Prep, can potentially stack if you want a big training stimulus (need to follow with enough recovery)
### Adjusting for Training Age
- just need to adjust volume and rep-length for age — young kids might only need 10-15m for accels, etc.
