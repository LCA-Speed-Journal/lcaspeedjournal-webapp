[[Ernie Clark]] — NAU, Ashland University (coached Trevor Bassitt)
- @ coachernieclark
Keeping things simple for both coaches and athletes can be the ticket to success.
# Hurdlers Can Become Lots of Things
- Best Body-Control Athletes
- Responsive off the ground (built with plyos)
- Great accelerators, focused and resilient
- Wide Range — 60m to 400m
- Amongst the Fastest Sprinters in your Program — Relay Keys
# Coaching the Hurdler as a Sprinter
Coach the principles you believe to be important.
- Mobility and Strength (Hip-Flexors)
- Acceleration and Aggression — Intensity
- Foot Strike and Dorsiflexion
- Posture
Overall training themes and fundamentals between sprinters/hurdlers is basically the same
	Can combine the two groups into one practice, though the session might change mid-practice
# Design the Day — Themes and Purpose
See also — [[Developing a Plan for Sprinters and Hurdlers]] on elite hurdle speed website
## General Ideas
- Stick to ~48hrs between high-Neural Days
	- Can run hard workouts (extensive tempo) even Meet+1, but don’t tax the nervous system
- Mix in Recovery Days, is more important to sprints/power-athletes than some want to believe
	- (connects strongly to [[Tony Holler]] and [[Alec Holler]] for hurdles)
## Day-Types
- Conditioning and Tempo — Coach Clark does early-week
- Acceleration and Starts — Coach Clark does early-midweek
- Max-Velocity — Coach Clark does mid-late in the week
- Recovery — Coach Clark has ~3 days p/wk (he takes Wed, Meet-Prep, and Sundays, if a Sat Meet)
	- For us, that’s a 48hr for the weekends, and we do low-days ~2x p/wk, for 4 recovery-days

# Building Your Practices
- What do you want the theme to be? 
	- Accel, tech, tempo, MaxV, Mix, etc.
- What would you do for a sprinter? Make the distances similar, but think in hurdles
- What do you and your athletes need to work on?
	- Hit that focus in the workout
- Quality over Quantity, both in Hurdles and in Sprints
- Make the Warmup Purposeful
- Build on the Last Week, the Last Meet, etc.
## Keeping it Simple
- Acceleration — mixing ijn hurdle-drills, hurdle-work, and non-hurdle work
- MaxV — mixing in Max-V hurdle reps afterward
- Can mix Short and Long-Hurdles in the same practice (short first)
- Build off the Purpose and the Theme
## Hurdle Drills and Progressions
(all on Coach Clark’s website)
## Weights for Hurdles
- Pre-Season — all about getting stronger in general movements
	- Mixing in unilateral work
- In-Season — Olympic-Lifting, Pin-Squats, Step-Ups
