# Speed Programming
### Strategy vs Tactics
**Strategy:** Plan about how to put things together effectively to achieve a major objective
- If understood, can rearrange details and adjust if something isn’t working
- Smart kid understands the logic, so he might not have all the facts/formulas memorized, but can figure it out with the underlying logic
- IRL: have to know how to break things down and put them together differently according to the situation
**Tactic:** Individual Steps and actions to get closer to your objective
- If you only get tactics, and things aren’t working, you won’t know how to adjust
- Don’t understand how to put things together in different ways
- The kid who only memorizes facts/formulas, but doesn’t know how to apply them
- School teaches to memorize without understanding the impacts/how to use: this is where we set people up to fail
### (Ch 2) Programming Essentials
#### Design 101
- Assess, Prescribe, Repeat
	- Assess: find high-ROI Opportunities, risks for injures, and personalize programs
	- Prescribe: use collected data during assessments to make objective decisions
	- Repeat: test again, and repeat with the new data
- Methods: Volume, Intensity, Progression
	- How much are you doing? (Sets, reps, rest, hours, days, cycles)
	- How difficult is it? (peed, load, effort, frequency)
	- How is the program changing? (Slow to fast, simple to complex, unloaded to heavy load)
#### FMS: Functional-Movement Screen
7 Essential Movements:
1. Deep Squat
2. Hurdle Step
3. In-Line Lunge
4. Active Straight-Leg Raise
5. Trunk-Stability Press-Up
6. Rotary Stability
7. Shoulder Mobility
Scoring: 0-3 in each
- Completed perfectly: 3pts
- Complete w/compensation: 2pts
- Unable to complete: 1pt
- Pain: 0pts
Thresholds
- 14+: Low Injury Risk
- <14: High Injury Risk
### Finding High ROI Opportunities
- Assess to find Strengths/Weaknesses: improve weak, then align training w/STR
- Improve weak until it’s not a limiting factor
- Aligning w/STR: weak and bouncy athlete might need STR, but shouldn’t sacrifice bounce in exchange (use natural talents, don’t train them out)
- Limitations to Personalizing for INdividuals in a Program:
	- Number of Athletes (p/session, and total you’re responsible for)
	- Level of attention p/athlete
	- Time you have available
- Tools to Personalizing
	- Systems you have in place
	- Tech you have in place
	- Team members you have
	- Amount of summed experience across the team
### (Ch 3) Assessing
#### Finding KPI’s
Definition: Measurable value/metric that helps orgs/individuals track/assess progress towards specific goals or objective(s)
- Speed Programming: allows to track progress towards becoming faster
- Informed decisions based on quantifiable data
- Evaluation tool for effectiveness of program
Macro KPI: objective data on long-term objectives (Big Picture Viewpoint)
- 100m Time, 40yd Time, 30m Accel
Micro KPI: objective data on short-term objectives (More detailed)
- 10-5 RSI, CMJ, Standing Broad, MaxV
- FVP, LVP, ASLR
- 1RM Squat or Hang-Clean
- Stride Length, Stride Freq., GCT, Air-Time, Block-Clearance
#### Using KPI’s
Certain KPI’s conflict/synergize
- Reactive strength improves GCT and maxV
- Max-Strength requires long GCT, so might be hard to improve both
#### Positive and Negative KPI Relationships
Positive
- Mobility — Stride-Length
- Elasticity — Stride-Frequency
- RFD — Power (Force x Velocity)
- Max-Strength — Power (Force x Velocity)
Negative
- Max-Strength — GCT, Mobility
- ECC-Strength — RFD
- Max-Velocity — Max-Strength

### (Ch 5) Prescribing
#### Periodization
Distinct phases or periods, each with specific goals/focuses — Each phases prioritizes adaptation using specific stimulus
- STR Phase: heavy squatting
- Speed Phase: little to no max-effort squatting
#### Macro & Microcycles
Macro: Overall training plan, often spanning several months
Meso: medium-term periods typically a few weeks to a few months
Microcycle: short-term, usually a week or so
#### Phases (typical):
Prep: foundation of general fitness, improving strength, endurance, and addressing weakness/imbalance
Pre-Comp: more specific, tailored to demands of the sport (sport-specific skills and tactics)
Comp: performance is primary focus, training geared towards peaking
Transition: after comp, allows for rest/recovery
#### Types of Periodization:
Linear: increase intensity, decrease volume over course of cycle
Undulating: varying intensity/volume within shorter time-frames
- Aim to prevent plateaus and enhance overall variability
Block: distinct focuses within a set period of time
- Blocks are typically shorter & more intense compared to linear
Conjugate: training multiple qualities within the same training phase
- Developing well rounded athletes
Reverse: less common, go from high-intensity low volume to low-intensity high-volume
Concurrent: concurrently training multiple throughout cycle
- Commonly used for team sports or multi-event athletics
