# Speed Secrets
## Ch 2) The Brain is Smart and Lazy
### Body is Smart/Lazy
- Will adapt to stress, will find shortcuts and compensate
- Will do minimum effort necessary, so we need to apply correct stress to stimulate desired adaptations
- Need to find weak points before the body’s compensations lead to injury
- Need to apply enough stress (volume, intensity, frequency)
### Tricking the Brain to Run Faster
- Adrenaline
- Competition: releases Adren
	- Caveat: not all athletes benefit from this
- Relaxation under Pressure: if you have Adren, but can’t relax, leads to tightness, panic, loss of technique
	- More exposure to comp, meditation, controlling the mind
- Potentiation: Do high-stress before doing low-stress
	- Nervous system is more prepped to fire at high-level
### Racing the Joggers
*Compensating for Lack of Training Partners, if you have a track*
Find a Jogger, Mark your Sprint Distances, Try to Beat them to the Last Marker
- Gauge their speed, gauge your speed, pick a challenge 
	- (ex. you’re going 0-50m, start when they hit 30m)
## (Ch 3) The Science Behind a 9.83 Sprinter:
*Lessons from Su Bingtian’s Coach*
Power Equation: Force x Velocity → Find your Weak Point
- high force but not fast? work velocity
- force low but decent speed? work power-production
### The Limiting Factor: The Ability to Reposition your Limbs
- Still need STR, PWR, Fast-Twitch, etc.
- But, eventually, limited by how fast you can reposition
### ERFD & TTP: 2 Most Important Metrics
*Reference: 25 metrics tracked for Su Bing & other elites, this was the difference between 10.1 and 9.9*
- RFD — rate of force, typically measured from moment muscle begins contracting
- eRFD (ECC RFD) — measured from moment muscle begins absorbing forces
- TTP (Time to Peak Power) — how fast can you absorb and reach peak power
### Su’s Training
- Su was lacking in Ankle Stifness and Calves
	- Analogy: Hitting ground w/poor ank. Stiffness is like hitting ground with wet rag (little force transfer)
- Solution: Seated Calf
	- Su trains to absorb forces and reach peak power fast
- Secret behind Su’s insane accel & 60m time — Resisted Sprints, Exogen Sleeves
## (Ch 4) Accumulation and Intensification
Accumulation: the Foundation of the House
Build the Capacity, 2wks of relatively higher volume w/low(er) intensity
Recovery: Allow CNS to recovery and adaptations to cement (1wk)
Intensification: Increase Intensity, Drop Volume (2wks, typically)
### Example 1: STR
2wks doing higher-vol max-effort squatting
1wk recovery
2wks doing lower-volume max-effort SL Squatting
### Example 2: PWR
2wks w/Power-Cleans
1wk Recovery
2wks w/Hang-Cleans
## (Ch 5) Strike and Switch Paradigm
Switching = Moving the Legs; Striking = Attacking the Ground
Speed: ↑ Stride Length + ↓ GCT + ↑ Stride Frequency
- Striking well impacts stride length and GCT
	- Effective = fast w/lots of force (assuming you have good force transfer thru good ank. stiffness)
- Switching well impacts GCT & Stride Frequency
	- Need to achieve right position in air to minimize GCT (neg. Foot speed)
	- Switching fast leads to faster frequency
### Stride Length Lacking? 
Look at Strike — Negative Foot Speed, Spiking GRF, Contact Distance
### Stride Freq Lacking?
Look at Switch — Figure-4 Lagging, Kicking in Front, Contact Distance
## (Ch 6) Figure-4 Mechanics
Indicator of good technique: the closer the better (but doesn’t need to be perfect 4)
- Good Foot Strike — Landing directly under body
- Good Recovery — Swinging knee close to striking leg
- Good Leg Stiffness — Standing Leg is relatively straight
### How to Improve:
Technical: Master Foot Strike
- Recovery and Leg Stiffness will Follow
Physical: Ankle and Leg Stiffness, and Elasticity
### How to Develop: Running Complex
- Running A: Gear 1 for 10m
- Running A: Gear 2 for 10m
- Running A: Gear 3 for 10m
- Running A: Gears 1-3 for 30m total
- Running A: Gear 3 to Sprint (10m + 10m)
- Sprint (20m, then 30m, then 40m, then 50m, then 60m)
## (Ch. 7) Negative Foot Speed
What is it? → Foot Traveling Backward in Space
- 2 Movements Simultaneously: Decelerate leg, extend the leg
### How to Improve: Reduce Ground-Contact Distance and Eliminate Overstriding
#### Eliminating Overstriding: 
- Neutral can be where a lot end up. Not ahead, but not traveling back and striking. 
	- Kinda just landing close to body, but not aggressively. 
- Missing factor with above example: usually have little to non negative foot speed
	- Leads to a lot of braking, even though they’re not reaching
#### Reduce Ground-Contact-Distance
Technical & Physical Requirements:
- Technical: can you control you limbs in space?
- Physical: Can you extend the leg fast enough?
Muscles to Work On:
- Glute-Max: Primarily for Hip-Extension
- Ham: Primarily for Leg-Decel
