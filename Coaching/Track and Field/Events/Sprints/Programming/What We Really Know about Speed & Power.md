# What We Really Know about Speed & Power
[[Jim Kielbaso]] — IYCA
## Basing Our Training in Science
When it comes to structuring training based on scientific principles, avoid both extremes.
- Neuroticism, Analysis Paralysis (see [[Austin Jochum]] for more on the theory/repurcussions)
	- Can lead to never actually developing a culture — bounce from framework to framework
	- Can lead to incongruence — “training whiplash” by constantly switching the main thing
- “Making Stuff Up” or, more simply, Only Being a Meathead
	- Need to have at least a reasonable hunch that the training will benefit the athletes — helps if this is grounded in some manner of scientific principle
## Speed
Very similar to [[Les Spellman]]’s definition of speed in [[+Certified Speed and Agility Coach|CSAC]]
	“**Large Forces** into the Ground as **Quickly As Possible**, in the **Right Direction** (efficiently)”
### Key Findings on Training / Developing Speed (From Studies)
#### Orientation of Force
Orientation of Force into the Ground is the primary determinant of running speed. For elite sprinters, they apply force into the ground in a different manner than regular people
- We know that this is also shown in a higher initial spike in force into the ground (as [[Ken Clark]])
#### Force and Mechanics
Faster sprinters have greater overall force and enhanced mechanics compared to slower runners.
- Need to actually teach athletes how to run — PE won’t do it, sport coaches don’t usually do it
## Key Principles of Training
Balancing Overload and Specificity.
- Systematically and Progressively Increase the Demands on the Body
## Strength and Speed
The “big force into the ground” comes from developing strength through the key musculature.
- I mean, duh. But might not be intuitive for everyone.
- Caveat — strength helps *to a point.* 
	- There’s diminishing returns once you start getting really proficient with absolute-strength.
### Squat Threshold
2x Bodyweight seems to be the general threshold where strength starts to have diminishing returns
- Training Application: weaker athletes need a stronger emphasis on strength training, while stronger athletes need a stronger emphasis on power training
	- Our numbers might look a little different, given that we’re a speed dominant sport
## Key Ideas when Training for Power
### Key Studies
#### Power is Specific, but more Relative to Velocity
While the patterns used are more generically transferable, the speed at which the movement is performed seems to have a little more transfer specificity.
- Slow-Side of Power — develops Slow-Side of Power
- Conversely, Faster Side develops Faster Side.
## Reactive Agility
Conversation about Offensive and Defensive COD — very reminiscent of [[(CSAC-4) Agility and COD]].
