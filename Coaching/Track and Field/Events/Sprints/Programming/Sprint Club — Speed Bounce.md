# Speed Bounce
### Intro:
- General Def: Produce High Force Fast, Absorb Fast, and do it Repeatedly
- Plantar-Flexor Chain: Calf-Muscles, Achilles, Foot-Muscles
- Mechanics: Lengthen in early stance, shorten in late-stance
	- Feet are also important, but need to develop elasticity in whole leg
- Ankle-Stiffness: Ability to absorb/produce force quickly (transfer of force when foot hits ground: faster it happens, the better)
	- Good stiffness: like hitting ground with hammer (as opposed to rag)
	- Benefits: Faster transfer leads to faster toe-off (faster stride freq.)
- Stride Freq: Air-Time + GCT
	- Better force transfer leads to more force into ground, which also increases stride length
- “Speed Bounce” is one of biggest “Secrets” behind speed
	- Can run fast with little strength training if you’ve got good bounce
	- Inverse is a lot harder
- Dorsi-Flexor Chain: Front Foot-Muscles and Tib Muscles (Ant/Post Tibs)
### (Ch 2) Max ECC Foot-Strength
#### Overview
- Def: Ability for foot to lengthen under high amounts of force
	- ECC is one of most effective ways to build strength
	- So 2-for-1: developing ECC builds max-STR too
- The Facts: elite sprinters apply 4-5x BW
	- Need to absorb it well to rebound
	- Build capacity for absorption before adding more (foundation of house before adding details)
- Calves: Critical Component — Weak calves will limit performance
- Developing MEFS:
	- Taking 3-10s on the way down
	- Play around with foot positioning (neutral, toe-out, toe-in)
#### Exercises
- ECC Standing Calf (double or SL)
	- Suggested: 25 Reps p/set, 2-3 sets
- ECC Tibialis
	- Suggested: 25-50 Reps p/set, 2-3 sets
- BW Variations
	- Way more reps needed, and slower ECC: 5-10s ECC, 50-100 reps
### (Ch 3) Foot Reactive Strength
#### Overview
- Max STR = Max force 1x
- Max ECC = Absorb max force
- Reactive STR = producing max forces repeatedly, for many reps
	- Pair foot STR training with Plyos
	- Build STR and also handle high amounts for multiple reps
- Developing FRS:  Same movements as ECC, but faster reps
	- Heavy as possible without having tech fall apart
	- Remembering that Sprinting is high force + multiple reps + speed
#### Exercises
- Reactive Calf Raise
	- Suggested Reps: 25 reps x 2-3 sets
- Reactive KB Raise
	- For Tibialis: heel on ledge, KB on toes, raise up and down
	- Suggested Reps: 25 x 2-3 sets
- Reactive Tibialis
### (Ch 4) Ankle Tendon-Stiffness
Tendon Def: Connects muscle to bone–stretchy on one end, stiff on other
Characteristics:
- Good Accel, Poor maxV
- Good Horiz PWR, poor stiffness
- Poor Accel, Good maxV
- Poor Horiz PWR, good stiffness
### (Ch 5) Drop Strength
- Ability to absorb forces as as tissues lengthen
	- Ex. dropping off box into a squat
	- Similar to ECC Strength, but emphasis is on lengthening with high-speed
- Important for Prep: ligaments, tendons, muscles, and joints better handles demands of sprinting/jumping
### (Ch 6) Hip/Knee Reactive Strength
Ability for tissues surrounding Hip/Knee to rapidly contract and relax powerfully for multiple reps
- Need elasticity so that the body can keep up
- Need glutes, hams, quads, etc. to produce lots of force rapidly, over and over
- Strain: muscles can’t relax fast enough, so as knee bends there are spikes in forces
	- Sprinting is also about relaxing fast repeatedly
### (Ch 7) Hip/Knee Stiffness
- Ability of hip/knee to resist lengthening — Maintain their angles as they hit the ground, as well as in the air
- If they collapse when hitting ground, or lose angles in air — Lose technique, lose time, lose speed, risk injury
