# Game Speed
### Intro:
Speed is Power: being fast allows you to get to goal (end zone, basket, etc) sooner
- Could result in blocking points or scoring points
- Fastest players generally score more, defend more, and perform better
### (Ch 2) Track vs Team Sports
Key Differences: 
- Starts
	- Running Start (most common for team-sport)
	- Side Start
	- Standing Start
	- 2pt
	- 3pt, Block Start (sport-specific, football and track respectively)
- Distances
	- Varies depending on sport (generally between 5-20m)
- Speeds
	- Max speed components differ based on sport
	- Rugby faster than soccer, but slower than track, etc
- Endurance
	- Team Sports: Repeated Sprints
	- Track: End of Race
### (Ch 3) Types of Speed
- What happens as speed increases:
	- Contact shifts to ball-of-foot
	- Thigh comes up higher (front-side)
	- Recovery higher
	- Arms open up more
- MSS: Maximal Sprint Speed
	- The higher your max-speed, the less effort it takes to keep up with others with a lower MSS
	- Your 80% might be someone else’s 100%
	- A sustainable value for you might be unsustainable for others
	- This is where you make up the difference on the court/field
- Developing MSS:
	- Quality: Long Rest Periods, Distances near 60m, Low Reps → No Junk Volume, each rep at max effort
- Frequency: 2x p/wk → Realistically, hard to maintain quality above this
	- 48hrs between sessions → CNS takes longer to recover
- Programming: General to Specific
	- Deload Weeks
- Advanced Techniques:
	- Load-Velocity-Profiling for Sled Work
	- 10-5 RSI Testing
### (Ch 4) RSA: Repeated Sprint Ability
- Max Speed is imperative, but running fast a singular time isn’t enough in team-sports
	- Short Sprints w/short-recovery (1:2-3 ratio, 6s sprint w/10-12s rest)
- Developing RSA:
	- Classic Sprint Training: Greatest Improvement in MSS
	- Interval Training: Superior when it comes to training for fatigue-resistance
	- Combination of Classic & Interval may be best strategy to improve RSA
- Sample Program (statistical significance in fatigue-resistance)
	- 15x(6s Sprint; 1min jog recovery); 3-5x p/wk for 8wks
	- 8x(30s at 130% of vO2Max; 90s rest); 3-5x p/wk for 8wks
- Avg. Sprint time higher for intermittent-sprint training than for speed-endurance
	- Speed endurance is a waste of time if you’re slow
	- “If there is no speed, there is nothing to endure”
- Workouts for RSA:
	- 8 x (30s @ 130% Vo2Max: 90s Rest); 3-5x p/wk, 8wks
	- 2 x 4 (30s; 60s rest; 2min between sets); 3x p/wk, 8wks
	- 2 x 4 (10s; 30s rest, 2min between sets; 3x p/wk, 8wks
### (Ch 5) Agility and Change of Direction
- Change of Direction: Planned Movements or Known Destinations
	- Accelerating, decelerating, and then re-accelerating in a new direction
- Agility: Similar to COD, but more cognitive skills involved
	- Requires athlete to respond to a stimulus, making a decision about where/how they’re going to move
- Workouts for COD:
	- L Sprints
	- S Sprints
	- Z Sprints
- Workouts for Agility:
	- Y-Sprint (someone calls L or R pivot)
	- T Sprint (someone calls L or R pivot)
	- U Sprint (someone calls when to pivot)
	- Stop Sprint (someone calls when to stop)
### (Ch 6) Programming Speed In-Season
- Law of Specificity — Closer the movement is to the movement you want to improve, the more it will transfer
- 48hr Rule — Body needs 48-72hrs to recover between intense training sessions
- The Power of 5 — Only need 5 solid sprints to develop max speed or RSA
	- Can perform before/after practice
### Example Progressions

| Weeks | Volume                | Surface    | Max-Distance |
| ----- | --------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1-4   | 300m p/wk; 100m p/day | Turf/Grass | 10m          |
| 4-8   | 500m p/wk; 160m p/day | Turf/Grass | 10-20m       |
| 8-12  | 600m p/wk; 200m p/day | Track      | 20-40m       |
| 12-16 | 300m p/wk; 100m p/day | Track      | 50-60m       |
