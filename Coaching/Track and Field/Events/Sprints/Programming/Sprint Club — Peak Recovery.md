# Peak Recovery
### (Ch 1) What is Peak Recovery?
#### Peak Recovery Pillars:
Sleep: Sleep 8hrs p/night
Energy: 3-10min sunlight in the morning
Hydration: hydrate with electrolytes
Mental: use the breath to control your mind
#### Purpose of Recovery:
Want to recovery mentally
Want CNS, soft-tissue, and bones to recover
Want to help that recovery, for all the parts that can impact performance
#### Recovery Pyramid:
Mental → Sleep → Habits → Mobility → Other
Mental first, because if you don’t believe, if you don’t have the confidence, you’re likely not gonna hit the other markers anyways
#### Zoom out Before you Panic:
It’s a long game. There are going to be bad weeks, just like there are going to be good weeks
Aim for overall trend being upwards
It’s not going to be a linear journey

### (Ch 2) Sleep
#### Sleep Protocols
FFC: Far from Comp
8+ Hrs, 15min naps before 3pm are fine
Keep things consistent
CTC: Close to Comp
Increase sleep hours, Increase naps if needed
Keep things very consistent
Science of Sleep
Circadian Rhythm: natural clock, controls sleep-wake cycle, hormones, body temp, and other essential functions
REM Sleep: Crucial for cognitive function, memory consolidation, and emotional processing
Occurs several times throughout night, and longer w each cycle
Deep Sleep: slow-wave sleep
Most restorative stage, crucial for physical recovery, immune support, and memory
Sleeping like an Athlete:
Room Temp: 65° is optimal
Sleep likely to occur most when core temp decreases, but this depends on geographical location/person
#### Natural Sleep Tricks:
No food 2-3hrs before sleeping
No caffeine 8-10hrs before sleep
No moderate to intense exercise 2-3hrs before sleep (walking good, but don’t go lift or anything)
Limit liquids 1-2hrs before bed
No phone for 30-90mins before bed
Blue-light blockers, night-shift
Low-fats before bed
Waking up Faster:
Mother nature’s sunlight
Direct light into eye without staring into light, light signals the wakeup
Indoor: 1,000 or less lux; Outdoor: 100k or more
Underslept? What to do:
Don’t do anything special, try to go to bed normally (naps/extra caffeine can mess up cycle even more)
#### Sleeping post-Competition:
Your body will gauge how much, sleep until you wake naturally
Pro-Athletes sleep 8-10+, not 7-8

### (Ch 3) Mobility
FFC: practice daily or morning if ideal (increase work as needed)
CTC: 1x daily, minimum; increase 1wk prior to competition; mobility on non-training days
Mobility vs Flexibility
Mobility is ability to hit ROM through muscle, without ext. Assistance
Flexibility is ability to hit ROM with assistance (gravity, partner, etc)
### (Ch 4) Mental
FFC: Use breathwork, make list of wins, keep promises, do mentally challenging things 
CTC: practice breathwork daily, at least 1wk prior; review wins daily, 1wk prior; reduce mentally challenging tasks
#### Breathwork:
Basic: 3-10min timer, just focus on breath
Box: 5 inhale, 5 hold, 5 exhale, 5 hold
Triangle: inhale 5, hold 5, exhale 5
Nervousness and Excitement are the Same:
Norepinephrine: neurotransmitter and a hormone
Same chemicals creating feeling of anxiety also create feeling of excitement
Increased HR so more energy can be provided to body
#### Building a Winner’s Mindset
Stack your Wins:
New Squat PR, 97 on exam, etc
Write. Them. Down
Progressive Densensitzation
Confront fear by doing more of it (use it or lose it)
Maintain Mindset
Environment Stability
Seek Difficult Situations
Keep adding to your “Win-List”

### (Ch 5) Daily Habits
FFC: Focus 2-3 essential habits, add new ones when existing become automatic
Focus on sleep, wake, weak-point habits first
CTC: Focus 2-3 essential habits, don’t worry about new in the week before comp
Science of Habit-Changing
Habit Loop: Trigger, Action, Reward
Habit Formation: formed in brain, neural path creation
Keystone Habits
Habits that have a ripple effect on other areas of life
Community Impact on Habits
Hard becomes standard
Weird becomes normal
Easier to get rich if you live with the rich, easier to lose weight if you live with gym-rats
Easier to become a high-level athlete if you live with high-level athletes
Find your Essentials:
2-3 that you need to function, apart from sleeping/eating, etc
Ex. to-do list night before, exercise, open laptop to work
Adding new Essentials: after the existing becomes automatic
