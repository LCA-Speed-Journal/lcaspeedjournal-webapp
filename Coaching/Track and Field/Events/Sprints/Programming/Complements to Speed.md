## Multi-Jumps
Acceleration:
- Standing Long-Jump
- Standing Triple-Jump
- Concentric Box-Jumps — 6-12 Total Takeoffs
	- Can also do this from one-foot
- Hurdle-Hops 
	- Static (singles) — tilt the hurdle-down, then +1 foot-length for spacing
	- Dynamic (repeat-hops) — tilt the hurdle down for spacing
	- Trying to Build up to 4 Sets of 4 Hurdles
- Vertical-Jump Testing — Standing or Approach
Max-V:
- Repeat-Bounding (3-5x) — 5s-Bound should be Standing-Triple + 75%
- Eccentric Box-Jumps (Depth-Jumps to a Box)
- Eccentric Box-Jumps into Dynamic Hurdle-Hops
- 
## Multi-Throws
- Underhand Forward — if toe-board, allow athlete to push off it
- Overhead Backwards — as UHF, allow toe-board use if available
- Med-Ball Slams
- Hop-Hop Overhead Back / Underhand FWD
## Weight-Room
- Cleans / Snatches
- Squats / DL (Trap-Bar)
- Jump-Squat
## Team Pentathalon
- Block-40m (or 30m + Fly-10), Standing Long, Standing Triple, Overhead MB, Underhand MB
	- Record, Rank, Publish
	- Classify by Team, Event-Group, and Classification

## Warmup Differences — MaxV vs Acceleration
### Acceleration
- Joint Mobility
- Warmup and Movement — akin to [[Dynamic Hip Sequence]]
- Dynamic Mobility — hip circles, fire-hydrants, leg-swings, etc.
- Accel Drills
	- Wall-Run
	- Resisted Walk
	- Resisted Ski
	- Resisted Run
	- Resisted → Unresisted Run (release after 8-10 steps)
- Accel-Specific Drills — Starts
### Max-Velocity
- Joint Mobility
- Glute-Activation — Bridges, Bird-Dogs, Double and SL Hops, etc.
- Movement Exercises and Dynamic — similar to Accel-Dynamic
- Specific Strength and Mobility
	- Ankle pops into technical-build
	- Straight-Leg shuffle into Prime-Times into technical-build
	- double-alternating fast-leg into technical-build
	- Marching-Run into technical build
- Technical Builds — seems like general HR-Raising (jumping jacks, pogos, star-jumps, tuck-jumps)
## Superblocks
- Acceleration — Hurdle-Hops, Block-Starts
	- Example — 2 x 10, 20, 40 — 5 x St-Long + 3 x St-Triple + 4 x Hurdle-Hop — Multi-Throws
- MaxV — Hop-Hop-OHB with light-implement, Fly-10 (30m build)
	- Example — 3 x Fly-10 — 3 x 5-Bound + 3 x Hurdle-Hop — Multi-Throws
