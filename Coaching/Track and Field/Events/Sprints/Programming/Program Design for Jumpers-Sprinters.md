# Program Design for Jumpers-Sprinters
[[Damar Forbes]] – Brown University (damar_forbes@brown.edu)
- Substantial Pedigree: 2x Olympian, 2x SEC Champ, 8x All-American, and lots more
- [[Airborne Sports LLC]] – Personal Company, works a lot with HS and College jumpers
## Transitioning
- Sprinter to Jumper: Faster, Sprint Mechanics, Top-End
	- Challenges: Learning new Tech and a Different Performance Focus
		- Tech: Approach, Takeoff Positioning, etc.
- Jumper to Sprinter: Explosive, Skill Development, Body Control, and Flexibility
	- Generally seen as an easier shift: pre-existing sprint experience, comparable accel, overlapping training
## The Importance of Speed
- Improves Runway Approach
- Better Force Application
- Reduced Braking Forces (Better Triple-Phases)
## General Prep
- Overall Fitness
- Sprint Mechanics
	- Basically every day in the form of sprint-drills
	- Northing Fancy: A-Series, Dribbling, Switching, MB Projections, Rollover Accels
- Minor Technical Training
	- ~1x p/wk (can combine with jumps to get to 2x, but 1x is a dedicated day)
- Weight-Training Techniques and Strength
	- 3x p/wk, can combine with sprinting (and combines well)
- Flexibility and Mobility
	- Basically every day
## Specific Prep
- Jumpers — Approach Consistency, Rhythm; Refine Jumping Tech
	- Upping the Tech-Days to a firm 2x p/wk — starting to add in Short-Approaches (6-8 steps), etc.
	- Wickets for Jumpers — emphasize posture, good turnover
	- Acceleration Ladder to emphasize big pushes in the first section of the approach
- Sprinters — Accel and Speed Endurance, Coordination and Force-Application
- Both — Reactive Strength, Elasticity, Anaerobic Power, Weight-Room Strength
## Pre-Comp
- Fine-Tuning 
- Assessing Readiness
- Event-Specific Stategies
- Balance Training Load and Recovery
- Improve Weaknesses
If a Saturday meet, would do 
	Speed Mon, 
	Tech Tu/Th, 
	Pre-Meet on Fri, 
	Weights on Wed (along with some supplement on Mon Speed)
## Comp / Championship-Phase
- Peak Performance
- Maintain Conditioning
- Execute under Pressure
- Refine Race/Event Strategies
- Sharpen Mental-Focus
Lightening the load 
	Mon Speed, 
	Wed Tech + Weights, 
	light weights or med-ball Tu, 
	Pre-Meet Thurs, 
	2-day Comp
