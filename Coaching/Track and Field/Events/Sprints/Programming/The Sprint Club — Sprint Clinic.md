# Sprint Clinic
## Intro
Levels of Speed
- 1 (New/Young) — >12.5 100m || 14.0 100m
	- Tests — 0-5m, Fly-10, ASLR
	- Need basic information on the start, top-speed, and injury risk
- 2 (Naturally Fast and/or Training Right) — 11-12.5 100m || 12-14 100m
	- Tests — All of Lv. 1, plus Force-Velocity-Profile
	- Adds in information on acceleration
- 3 (Naturally Fast and/or Focusing on Details) — Sub-11 100m || Sub-12 100m
	- Test — All Tests, including CMJ and RSI
	- Needs all the details for training specificity
## The Start — The First 5m
### Filming
- Filming from side-view, measure everything (both start and end)
	- Keep a few meters after the 5m mark in-frame
- Slow-mo Footage (240fps is best)
### Benchmarks
> [!NOTE] Coach Ross Note
> Benchmarks *are* a range, namely linking to [[James Wild]] and Athlete-Archetypes. Take the numbers with a grain of salt, but they’re a good starting point.

## Acceleration
### Describing a Force-Velocity Profile
- Peak Horizontal Power (Pmax) — are you weak and slow?
- Peak Horizontal Forces (F0) — are you weak?
- Peak Horizontal Velocity (v0)— are you slow?
- Ratio of Forces (RFmax)— are you striking ineffectively?
- Decrease in Ratio of Forces (DRF) — are you losing drive quickly?
### Performing a Force-Velocity Profile
- Camera: even with the 15m mark, 10m from the line
- 6 Splits: 5-10-15-20-25-30m
	- Pole Adjustment: Account for Parallax Effect
		- .57m ahead of 5m, .57 behind 25m
		- .28 ahead of 10m, .28 behind 20m
		- .85 behind 30m
		- Measurement: hips as they cross the markers
- Tools: Timing System, Camera, Measuring Tape/Wheel
	- Marking Splits: Cones, Plant Stakes, or Slalom Poles
	- Processing Data: MySprint, or use JB Morin’s Spreadsheet
- Standards: ranging from no experience to elite
	- Pmax — 3-4 to 10-12
	- F0 — 5 to 12
	- v0 — 6-7 to 25-30
	- RFmax — 20 to 60
	- DRF — -10 to -4
## Max-Velocity
Filming a 10m Fly Correctly
- Max Quality: Full Warmup (45-90min)
- 30-50m Flying Start
- Parallax Effect: .28 ahead of 0m and .28m behind 10m
- Essentials: Side-View, Clear Markers, Slow-Motion
## Injury Assessment
- What is an ASLR? → Active Straight-Leg Raise
	- Ability to stabilize pelvis under load + Ham & Hip-Flex mobility 
- How to Film an ASLR?
	- Lie on Back, Keep Both Legs Straight, Raise one as high as you can
		- Measure the Angle of the Leg
- Analyzing an ASLR:
	- Healthy is 87-90° ROM

## Power and Reactivity
- CMJ and RSI
	- CMJ is How Much Power (weak legs), RSI is How Reactive (weak feet)
	- Use hands-on-hips, jumping from squat position
	- Measure Leg-Length and Quarter-Squat Length
		- Leg: Distance from Greater Trochanter on Femur → tiptoe, with athlete supine while keeping full ankle plantarflex
		- Quarter-SQ: Measure vertical distance between greater trochanter and the ground in an optimal knee-flexed positon to perform jumps (~90°)
		- Push-Off Distance: Leg Length - Quarter-Squat
- Testing CMJ and RSI
	- CMJ: Squat Jump w/hands on waist
		- Measure Height and Airtime
	- 10-5 RSI: Squat Jump without using hands to jump higher → 5 or 10 jumps → Aim for minimal ground contact but maximal height
		- Measure GCT and Airtime
- Analysis of CMJ/RSI
	- RSI (height [m] / GCT)
		- Low: <1.5
		- Moderate: 1.5-2.0
		- Good: 2.0-2.5
		- High: 2.5-3.0
		- Elite: >3.0
	- CMJ for Sub-Elite: .44m (17.3”)
