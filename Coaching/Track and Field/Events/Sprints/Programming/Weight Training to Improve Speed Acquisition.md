# Weight Training to Improve Speed Acquisition
[[Boo Shexnayder]] — LSU
## Understanding Speed and Power
- Speed is a Neural Quality
	- Recruitment, Rate-Coding, and Synchronization/Coordination of Motor-Units
- Speed Development — It’s about not only What to Do, but also What Not to Do
	- Designing and Implementing Effective Speed Development Programming
	- Eliminating Obstacles to Speed Acquisition — in Other Areas of the Program
- Why Train Speed — Big Reasons
	- Faster and More Powerful
	- Improved Neuromuscular Integration
	- Increased Levels of Applied Localized Tension
### Sidebar — Glycolytic Basics
- High Level Glycolytic Training — Neural Irritant, has Effect on Speed/Skill-Acquisition
- Moderate Lactate — Endocrine Response, Increased Recovery, Restoration Training
	- It’s a Blurry Line, bhut it can help aid fitness when done at appropriate levels
## Understanding Strength
- Neural Quality — comes from Neuromuscular Integration
	- Recruitment, Rate-Coding, and Synchronization of Motor-Units
	- Integration — the Fast-Stuff, not the Slow-Stuff
- Improved Neuromuscular Integration — Prereq for STR-Development, Potentiates STR
### Key Supporting Concepts
- Neuromuscular Integration is Driven by Speed/Power Training
- Diversity Mitigates Risk of Repetitive-Stress Syndromes
- Keep Things **Simple**
	- Value Power-Output — Drives Neural Improvements
	- Value Muscle-Mass Involved — Endocrine Response
- Maintain Power-Output
#### Managing Intensity
- The Goal — Achievement of Intensity in the STR-Program
- Lower Intensity Training — Endocrine-Support and Stimulation
- Progression —  Light → Mix of Light/Heavy
- **High Intensity** is Supported by **Low Density**
## Training by Body-Type — Smalls and Bigs
- The Same
	- Speed and Power Development
	- Quality Based Approaches
- The Different
	- Smalls — Limiting the Weight-Training List
	- Bigs — Expanding the Weight-Training List (a little)
### Rethinking the Secondary Lift Philosophy
Shortening the amount of exercises can increase the quality of the others
- Maybe pulling things out and working them into other days
	- Circuit-Work with Secondaries as Recovery-Volume, etc.
- Bodybuilding
	- How — Circuit-Style, Small-Muscle Exercises, numerous sets of 10-15, short recovery
	- Why — Short-T Endocrine Stim, Long-T Endocrine Fitness, Glycog. Storage, STR-Supplem.
	- When — Stand-Alone (often following Neural Lifting), Long-Term Planning Thoughts
## Compatible training Design
- The Stimulus — Clear Messages at the Cellular Level, Compatible Training Arrangements
- Group by Neuromuscular Demand
	- Grouping Neural Agents — Speed, Plyos, and Major-Lifts
	- Grouping General Agents — General-STR, Med-Ball, Circuits, General Fitness
## Olympic Lifting — the Value
- Complex Strength, Skill-Transfer
- Need to be good at Teaching the Movements
	- However, once there’s competence, there’s minimal negatives to their inclusion
## Squats and Presses — the Dilemma
- Pros — STR-Development, Endocrine-Development, Balancing the Body
- Cons — Elasticity Losses, Discoordination of Complex Patterns
	- Long, Slow Nature of Heavy Lifting Can Fatigue the Proprioception
	- Just need to be Careful with how they’re Scheduled
- Solutions
	- Minimize the Exposure
	- Patience in the Progression
	- Precede with Neuromuscular Integration Work
	- Discontinue or use Special Strategies at Certain Times
## Ballistic Lifting
- Tension vs Time-Under-Tension
- Typical Exercises — Speed Presses, or Loaded Jumps
- Parameters — 10-50% BW, 5-12 Reps, 4-6 Sets per Region of the Body
	- Want Athletes to Stay Explosive — remember that quality drops for PWR after 5-6 Reps
## Balance and Targets
- Balanced Development — keeping Absolute STR, Power, and Elastic STR in Balance
- 1 : 1 : 1.5 — Clean, Bench, Deep-Squat
- Bodyweight Factors — once Squat gets to 2.1-2.2x BW, that’s likely “Strong Enough”
	- Increasing beyond that point can lead to more problems than solutions
## Training Phases
- Balance Modes of Training vs Following the Calendar
### Phase 1 — Neuromuscular Integration Improvement
- Improve Rate-Coding and Recruitment
	- Basic Power-Work
	- High Density and Sets of Light Olys
	- 50-65% for Bar-Speed and Safety — don’t go heavier, go faster
	- Sets of 4-5 for Moderate Lactate
	- Need to Work on Acceleration Development Training
- Prep for Advancement in Absolute STR in Phase 2
	- Squat/Press/Pull
	- Ceiling — 75%
	- Rep Ceiling — 30-45 p/region (Smalls vs Bigs)
	- Keep it Simple — 1-2 Upper, 1-2 Lower (Smalls vs Bigs)
### Phase 2 — Absolute-STR Development, Power Advancement
- Maintain Contact with Basic Power — “Home Base” Philosophy
	- Continue Neuromuscular Integration Work on a Regular Basis
	- Oly’s — Sets of 4-5, 50-65% for Bar-Speed and Safety
- Improve Power Production
	- Periodic Advancement of the Oly-Lifting Program
	- Intensity Ceiling — 70-85%, 2-4 Reps
- Achieve Significant Increase in Absolute-STR — for those who need it
	- Simple Approaches — Low-Rep, High Intensity
	- Rep Ceilings (Split over Sets) — 15 for Smalls, 30 for Bigs
	- Limit Exercises — 1-2 Upper and Lower (Smalls vs Bigs)
	- Only go heavy 1x p/wk — Other Days, Diversify Elsewhere
		- Ceiling at 80%, same ceilings for reps
		- Multiple Exercises — 2-3 per Body-Region
- Re-Establish Absolute-STR — for those who have it
	- Employ Similar Approaches to Absolute Strength Development
	- When Achieved? Shift to a Ballistic-Based Program
### Phase 3 — In-Season Training Management
- Polarized Approach — Really Intense, or Easy to Recover From (Stay Away from Middle)
- Introduction of High-Level Power-Training (RFD)
	- Low-Density, but High-Intensity
	- Low-Reps, High Intensity Schemes
	- Olys at 90-100% (2x3 Warmup, 2/2/2/1/1, etc.)
- Maintain Neural Stimulation
	- Maintain Contact with Basic Power — Olys at 50-65%, Sets of 4-5
- Maximize Proprioceptive Function
	- Discontinuing Squat/Press Work — Great for the Smalls
		- Introducing Ballistics for Maintenance / Enhancement
	- High-Intensity, Low Density for Squat/Press/Pull Work
		- 90% or higher, low-reps
		- Fill in with Ballistics
		- Proprioceptive Supercompensation Possibility
