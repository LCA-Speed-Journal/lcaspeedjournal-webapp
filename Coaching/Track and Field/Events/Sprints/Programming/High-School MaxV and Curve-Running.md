# High-School MaxV and Curve-Running
Curve-Running: Competing 1v1 (facing opposite directions, curve out and drive down field in a linear finish)
	Short curve, almost immediately after the first step we’re doing a tight-90°
Transitioning from those curved (warmups?) into more speed-prep
	Toe-Up P.Times, Single-Switches,
	(interesting patttern for next ones: 5yd on, 5yd walk, repeat) Switch+Bounce, Triple-Switch
	Dribbles: in-place, go on signal. Ankle, Calf, Knee.
	10yd Accels into 10yd Wickets: 2 Reps
Fly-Zone: Building Out (10yd Fly-Zone)
	2 Reps at 10yds out
	2 Reps at 20yds out (Les calls out that under 1.00 from 20, and 0.98 from 30 is 4.5ish 40yd)
	2 Reps at 30yds out (a couple reps has a 3yd skip-in before the start)
