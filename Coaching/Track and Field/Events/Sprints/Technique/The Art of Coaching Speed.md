# The Art of Coaching Speed
## Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Energy Leaks
- (Chronic / Acute) Injury Factors
- Interference with Key Sport-Movement-Needs
- Efficient versus Effective
## Movement Strategies: Variables in Play
- Leveraging Variables to Gain Speed — Lever and Axis Systems
- Joint / Muscle-Timing Systems
- Momentum factors, Speeds of limb-movements
- Support Phase, Flight Phase
## Seeing Motion
- Perspectives: Frontal, Rear, Panning, Above
- **Checklist Flowchart:**
	1. Postures
	2. Shapes
	3. Segments
	4. Landmark Positions
	5. Joint Angles
	6. Movement Pathways
### KPI’s for Acceleration
- Spinal and Hip Engines
- Joint & Muscle Order
- Projection Angles and Force Application
- Stride Rate of Change
- Harmony of Stride Frequency / Stride Length — With Each Step, getting Longer + Quicker
- Total Body Axis-to-Ground Angles
- Transitions and Positions of Appendages
- Ground-Contact, Amortization, and Flight-Times
### Top-End Speed Mechanics
- Posture (All Planes)
- Strike Landmarks for the Foot — Striking slightly supinated, rolling through big-toe
- Arm Positions, Angles
- Leg Angles
- Dorsiflexion — Pretension
- Undulation/Oscillation of Hips/Shoulders
- Ground-Contact and Flight-Times
- Joint Stiffness Mechanics  — Pretensing, etc.
- Direction of Force-Application
- Limb-Repositioning — Timing and Factors
