## Finding the Why
[[Simon Sinek]]’s Book, recommended again
- Need to find “the athlete’s WHY”
- Question 1: If you weren’t (insert sport athlete), what would you do?
	- Need to understand what makes the athletes tick
- Question 2: What’s the toughest thing you’ve been through in your life?
- Question 3: Who’s the most influential person in your life?
	- Many stories of calling them up and talking up the athlete — has changed relationships with athletes because if their most influential person signs off on the coach, can make a big deal to the athlete
## Defining Terms
When we reduce things like speed down to “stride length x stride-frequency,” can make it feel pretty immutable. 
	Need to expand our definitions to feel like athletes have more agency over these changes
### Sprint Performance Model
Sprint Performance breaks out into 
- Stride Frequency — Feeds from Coordination and Speed
	- Develop with Body-Awareness, Movement Awareness, Balance
- Stride Length — Feeds from Strength
	- Develop with Strength-Training and Overload-Training
- Technique — Feeds from Flexibility, Mobility, and Sport-IQ
	- Warming up with physiological, biomechanical, and specific readiness
	- Flexibility and Mobility — Hurdle Mobility, Wall-Drills, etc.
	- Sport IQ — not just about raw outputs, but how you can use it on the field/court as well
## Hands-On Component
- Tip: If no wall present (on field, etc), can use 2 additional athletes to form one
	- Athlete 1 stands tall as the wall (feet together, arms at sides)
	- Athlete 2 stands on the opposite side of Athlete 1, bracing them against performing athlete
	- Athlete performing drill uses Athlete 1 to brace against.
	- Groups off 2 would then rotate to allow all athletes to do the drills
