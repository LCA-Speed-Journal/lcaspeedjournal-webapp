# Sprint-Based Hurdling (Full-Lecture)
## General Philosophy
- Happy, Healthy, Fresh (Athletes First)
- Simple, Essentialist Approach
- Speed is the Priority (over endurance, over technique)
	- Full-Speed Reps are better than drills
	- Maintain health over fitness always
## Your Role as the Hurdle Coach
- Cause-Effect-Solution
- Use Video Evidence
- Build Confidence
- Find Minimum Effective Dose (Beware Over-Drilling)
- Facilitate Success
## Rules
- 2-Hurdle Rule
- 10-Hurdle Rule
- Always Discount
- Always Max-Effort (Spiked Up, Full-Speed)
### 2-Hurdle Rule // 10-Hurdle Rule
- Correct Form creates momentum and strong finish
- Regularly-Scheduled Lactic with Sprinters is enough
- Poor finish is a symptom, not a cause 
	- Problem A: momentum to the first hurdle
	- Problem B: momentum between hurdles
### Always Discount (Short-Hurdles)
- Never Race-Height / Race-Distance
- Always Adjust as Needed (weather, athlete, daily focus)
#### Beginner Hurdle Progression
- Mini-Hurdles — more experienced, graduate higher/farther
- #1: Learn the Trail-Leg Mechanics (Safety)
- #2: Focus on Takeoff/Landing
- #3: Focus on 8-Steps to Hurdle-1
- #4: Focus on 3-Step between Hurdles
- Think about Arms Last
## Long-Hurdles (Sidebar)
- Goal is only to perfect the steps
- Keep the 2-Hurdle Rule
- Never Discount these
- Avoid leg-switch to eliminate need for extra reps
- Bad-Steps or Bad-Rhythm make the hurdlers *look* less fit
## Start & Approach
- Long and Strong, Get Tall
- Eyes on the Hurdle after 2 Steps, Quicken Stride After 4 Steps
## Cut-Step
- No Knee-Drive, Swing-Low
- Pull it Under, Land Under Hips
	- Transfers Vertical Force to Horizontal Momentum
- Ball-of-Foot
## Takeoff
- 7ft Away for Boys (6-6.5ft for girls)
- Neutral Hips, No-Heel
- Nose-Past-Toes, Triple-Extension, Hip Displacement
## Lead-Leg
- Lead with a Bent-Knee
	- Will Extend on its Own after a Proper Takeoff
- Create Big-Split between the Knees (SSC)
- Neutral-Hip
- Max Extension should happen *before* hurdle
## Trail-Leg
- Coach them **not to hit the hurdle.**
- Trail-Leg Speed is an effect of a good lead-leg split
- Knee — Higher than Foot
- Toe — Up and Out
- Heel — Heel-to-Butt
## Arms
- Don’t Overcoach them (largely act as a stabilizer)
- Bent-Elbow, Elbows Out
- Flexed-Wrist
- Don’t Cross Midline, Fight to Stay Square
## Landing
- Power Position
	- Good Posture, Landing Under the Hip
	- High Knee
	- Avoid Collapsing
- Most Undercoached, Important Aspect of Hurdling
	- One-Footed Landing
	- “Bouncing Off” the Lead-Leg
	- Don’t Reach. **Ever.**
## Scheduling
- 3-4 Days p/wk Maximum
- Alternating 1 or 2 Hurdle-Days
- Don’t Hurdle Every Meet
- Offseason Focuses — Speed, General Athleticism (GPP)
## Sample Weekly Plans
### Plan A: Saturday Meet
- M — Lactic
- T — Rest
- W — Hurdle-Day (Reps over 2)
- Th — Speed
- F — Pre-Meet Hurdle-Day (Long Hurdle Starts over 1)
- Sa — Meet
- Su — Rest
### Plan A: Tu-F Meets
- M — Pre-Meet Hurdle Day (Starts over 1)
- T — Meet
- W — Rest
- Th — Speed
- F — Meet
- Sa — Rest
- Su — Rest
## Sample Hurdle Day: Practice Plan
- Low-Impact Hurdle-Drills
	- Can be done daily for tech/muscle-memory
	- Zero landing / pounding
- Speed Drills
- Accels in Spikes — 8-Step Drill
- Confidence Drill
	- Goal to feel what it’s like to lead into hurdle
	- Slow, high-knee approach
	- Works hip-displacement by forcing them to wait to accelerate
	- Land far past the hurdle
- Full-Speed over Hurdles 1 or 2
