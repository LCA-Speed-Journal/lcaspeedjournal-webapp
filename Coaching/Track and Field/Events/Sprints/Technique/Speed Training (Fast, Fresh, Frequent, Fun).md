# Speed Training (Fast, Fresh, Frequent, Fun)
[[Zach Dechant]] — TCU Baseball

## Organizing Training
Number 1 Priority: need to organize training to *optimize recovery*.
- Don’t do speed work after you’re lifting (can flip, but don’t lift and then try and sprint)
	- You *need* to be sprinting before you lift. Speed is the priority, so you need to make it the priority.
	- Lifting is the accessory to the field-based performance, while speed has direct impact
	- Added risk of injury when you sprint after you lift (particularly hamstring)
- Manage Athlete-Tension: relaxation is the key to sprinting fast
	- Cue: run the first rep at 95% — if the second is slower, lets you know that the athlete is pushing too hard and tightening up
### Using a High-Low Model
[[Charlie Francis]] was the pioneer of this model (disagree with some of his stuff, but the principle is good)
- High CNS Training Session
	- Key Technical Skill Development
	- High Motor-Unit Recruitment
	- Axial Loading
	- Speed and Intent of Movement
	- Multi-Joint Exercises
- Low CNS Training Session
	- *”Just because it’s a low day doesn’t mean it’s easy/recovery, it’s just going to be different than the days we expect high outputs.”*
- Need to Remember: not always trying to put the athletes in a box (for programming, for periodization, for the training model)
	- Monday isn’t always the most opportune day to train max-effort — weekend can screw up the recovery of the athlete, they’ve spent days away from the sport, etc.
- New Model: Less is More
	- Monday: Regeneration
		- *”I will never go back. We had the best season ever after changing Monday to more of a ‘knock the rust off’ day.”*
	- Tuesday: Speed and Power (+STR-Development)
	- Wed: Off or Regeneration
	- Thursday: Rust-Buster
	- Friday: High-Outputs
### Everything is Holistic
Ultimately, we’re stress-managers. Never know what athletes are going to be coming in with, the things they’ve done outside practice, their recovery.
## Myth: Team Sport Athletes Rarely Hit Top-Speed
Old-School programs: not prioritizing speed in the early-seaon, then when it comes time to test 40s, people get hurt. 
	They incorrectly associate the top-speed work with the injuries, rather than the unpreparedness of the athletes (and the consequent intensity spike) with the injuries.
If you can’t do anything else, do 20yd runs. You’ll get to at least 90% speed just doing that.
- There’s no substitute for sprinting — doing things in the weight room can build resiliency, can build robustness, but there’s no substitute for actually sprinting (EMG data doesn’t even come close)
## 6wk Intervention to Change Sprint Posture
- Day 1 — Dribbles, A-Variations / PVC Runs, Wickets
	- Zach Testimonial: uses PVC Runs a lot, recently had a huge team-breakthrough by using them more frequently with his team
- Day 2 — Resisted Accels, Pelvic Motor Control
	- Pelvic Motor Control is a 
- Day 3 — PVC Runs, High-Speed Wickets
### Zach’s Sub-Maximal Training Components:
- Wickets / MB Runs (latter can sub for former, or vice-versa, or use both)
	- Zach doesn’t like wickets, but they have their place depending on the program
- PVC Runs
- Dribbles, Dribble Bleeds into MaxV
- Dribble Tempo-Runs for Posture
## Why Constantly Chase Speed?
Frequency is a huge component for training speed
- We know about Training Residuals — max-speed fades the fastest out of each of the key qualities
- At TCU, never go a full week without at least one day training top-speed
	- Exceptions to this are when doing buildups or progression phase
### TCU Acceleration-Progression: 
- Just buildup the distance on the build over a few weeks (5-10, 10-10, 15-10, 20-10)
	- 20-10 is the max distance used at TCU (because their indoor turf area is only 40yds)
	- Repeat the progression once you hit the end, then you have block-periodization
## What Leads to Breakdown
- Large jumps in workload— Injury-Risk
	- New Research on mileage-development: it’s not the spike across a week, it’s the spike within a workout
		- 10% increase over the max distance covered within the last 30 days of training — Risk-Factor
- Average Practices can be up to 40% higher than what is seen in a game — Preseason Injuries can happen because athletes aren’t prepared for the spike in workload
	- In many programs, the highest load within the entire year can be seen within the first 3-7 days of practice — “Shiny New Toy Effect”
		- Need to educate on progressing into the season — connects to “you should be uncomfortable with how little you do in the first week of practice”
