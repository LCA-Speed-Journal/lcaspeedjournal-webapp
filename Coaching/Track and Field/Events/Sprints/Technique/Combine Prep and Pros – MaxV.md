# NFL Combine Prep – MaxV

> [!NOTE] Coaching Note
> [[Cici Murray]] leading this one, Les assisting

Players wearing Catapult (GPS Tracking for volume, intensity, accels/decels)
## Warmups:
- Shuffle with Arm-Swing,
- Carioca,
- Knee Pulls + jog (pull to 10, jog to 20)
- Frankenstein Kick + jog
- Skip into Lunge + Reach (I like this one, save for [[2026 Warmup Ideas]])
- Kick and Reach
- Stick-Drills (look like they might be weighted)
	- Overhead Marches for Mobility
	- Overhead Marches for Force-into-Ground
	- Overhead A-Switches (Singles, then Triples)
- Hurdles-Drills (low Hurdles, knee-height)
	- Hurdle-Hop to Rebound Jump (emphasize the drop after the rebound, brief pause)
- Vertical Jump (Hands-on-Hips)
	- Not sure if we’re measuring on force-plates or a jump-mat here — could be watching height, could be watching impulse/braking. Can see them calling out heights, so that’s *one of* the metrics for sure.
- More Stick-Drills
	- Half-Kneeling Rotations (focused on spine, head is straight ahead while torso turns)
- Med-Ball Drills
	- Overhead Tilts (small oscillations L/R)
	- MB Prime-Times (bent-knee)
## Short Accels
10yd build into ~10m wickets

# Pros – MaxV
Simple warmups – Prime-times, power-skips, buildups
Vertical Jump (hands-on-hips) – Force-Plates
Contrast Sprints:
- 1080 runs out to 20 (looks like lighter weight, more to potentiate pre-sprints)
- Unresisted Sprint
90% Sprint (longer lead, 15-20yd lead before the zone)
1080 Accels (heavier load here, waving *up* across 4 reps)
1080-resisted Prime-Times (not going for max-speed, it looks like, but rather smooth power-output)
