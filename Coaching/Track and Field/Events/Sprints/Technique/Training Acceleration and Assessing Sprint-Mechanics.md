# Training Acceleration and Assessing Sprint-Mechanics
[[JB Morin]] — 
- Sport-Only is not efficient beyond a certain level — need some kind of sprint-focused training that targes magnitude / orientation of force more specifically
## Heavy Resisted Sprinting
- Need to go after vDec, rather than %BW (in an ideal world)
- Different Loads affect Different Parts of the Spectrum
	- Effect depends on the Initial Profile *per athlete.*
	- Depends on training objectives, context, and period of time — Not a one-size-fits-all
## Sprint Mechanics and Hamstring Injuries
Mismatch between capacity of the muscel adn the mechanical strain
- Macroscopic Strain: amount of high-speed running (>90% vMax)
- Microscopic Strain: running-strategies that bias / shield certain tissues
	- Connects to [[James Wild]]’s Quadrant System
### Prevention
- Pre-Season F0 is not related to Risk, but In-Season F0 is *significantly* related
	- Lower F0 is correlated — suggests that weakness at high-force / high-velocity is a risk
- Anterior Tilt is also a contributing risk-factor (places the hamstrings at greater stretch)
## Other Common Soft-Tissue Injuries
Trunk Lean + Pelvic-Drop at Touchdown (Glute-Med Weakness) = Risk-Factor
- [[Chris Korfist]] would point to a Crossover-Gait as a symptom of this weakness (lateral instability)
### How to fix this?
Simplifaster Article Summarizing Research — [[Sprinting in Team Sport: The Butt-Kicking Epidemic]]
- Adjust Knee-Height
- Adjust Thigh-Swing
- Adjust Pelvic-Tilt — more Neutral Posture
- Adjust Knee-to-Knee Distance
