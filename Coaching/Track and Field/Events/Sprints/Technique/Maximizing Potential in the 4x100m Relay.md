# Maximizing Potential in the 4x100m Relay
[[Brian Fitzgerald]] — Ventura College
## Basics
### Relay Legs
- Legs 1, 3 will run on the inside (left-half) and receive baton in the right hand.
- Legs 2, 4 will run on the outside (right-half) and receive baton in left hand.
### Relay Measurements — Old vs New
- Old — Acceleration Zone (10m) → Exchange Zone (20m)
- New — No Accel-Zone, just a 30m Exchange-Zone
### Typical Acceleration vs Deceleration
- 60% by 10m — 85% by 20m — 95% by 30m
	- Decel: 98% at 80m — 95% at 90m-100m
#### How does this Apply to Exchange Zone?
- Taking off slower (eg. 80%), not an aggressive accel? Not exchanging at high velocity. 
- Goal is to minimize the deceleration of the *baton*
- Want outgoing to be up to speed by the time they’re receiving the handoff
	- Later means higher speed, but also unpredictability — less room for error, fatigue from the incoming runner, speed mismatches leading to missed gap, etc.
	- Sweet spot tends to be about 20m of total accel from the outgoing runner — halfway to ⅔
## The Cardinal Rules of the Relay
- Outgoing runner sets up at the very beginning of the exchange zone.
- Baton Exchange should happen near the 20m mark to maximize outgoing-acceleration
## Determining When to “GO”
*If allowed 2 pieces of tape (tennis balls, etc):*
- First Piece — 16-24 steps from start of zone (Might be a little less for JV or Youth)
	- Only variable piece of the relay — need to move so runners mesh in the Exchange
- Second Piece — Measure Back 4 more Steps (creating a “Go-Zone”)
	- Outgoing leaves when incoming enters the Go-Zone
### Guidance for the Outgoing Runner
- May stand/crouch, but feet should be pointed down the track — don’t line up sideways.
- Tip: can always line-up on the outside of the lane — take a tangent to cross if needed
- Aggressive Start, don’t come out with any hesitation
	- Smooth, Powerful Pressure
- Extend a soft, steady hand on a verbal cue — Single-Syllable, something that isn’t “stop” or “wait”
	- Soft Hand Logic — stiff hand = potential for baton bouncing off
	- Steady Hand takes effort, need to have tone through shoulder to keep straight-arm at speed
- Grasp the baton *after* placed in the hand — don’t go fishing
- Don’t look back! (Caveat: if you’re 5m from the end, maybe. But only if something’s wrong.)
### Guidance for the Incoming Runner
- Must push through the zone — “Catching the Outgoing Runner”
	- Need solid form to not slow down here (and speed-endurance, but that’s a duh)
- Give the verbal cue at an appropriate time
- Extend baton at the appropriate time
- Maintain speed in the zone *after* the pass — sometimes it’ll glance off, need to keep pressure
- Stay in lane until all other teams have completed their passes
## Psychology — Running in the Zone
- The exchange zones are the most critical areas of the relay
- Goal — minimal decrease in the speed of the baton
- Incoming — enter with the idea of catching (and even running past) the outgoing runner.
	- Any slowing can (and will) result in an inferior exchange.
	- Don’t relax mentally. Attack and push through the zone — “Finish Your Leg”
- Outgoing — accelerate smoothly and powerfully, without hesitation.
	- Any interruption in acceleration will slow the baton, can make incoming hit the brakes.
## How Far Does Each Runner Run?
*Presuming an exchange ⅔ into the Exchange Zone*
- Leg 1 — Standing Start, 100m w/baton, 100m Total
- Leg 2, 3, 4 — 20m Accel, 100m w/baton, 120m Total

- Leg 2, 3, 4 — 20m Accel, 100m w/baton, 120m Total
## Personal Placement Considerations
### Leg 1 — good starter, good turn-runner
- Often a shorter athlete
- Can “hide” an athlete who has trouble receiving
### Leg 2 — good baton-handler, well-developed sprint-endurance
- Often a taller athlete
- Generally faster than Leg 3 Runner
### Leg 3 — good baton-handler, good turn-runner
- Often a shorter athlete
- Can “hide” slower-athletes here
### Leg 4 — aggressive, resilient, handles pressure well
- Doesn’t have to be the fastest, but can help (has the straight)
## Teaching and Practicing
### Progression for Teaching the Pass
- Stationary with receiving hand back
- Stationary with arm-swings and verbal cue
- Jogging with (and without) verbal cue
- Staggered sprinting with (and without) verbal cue
### Practicing the Exchange
- Effectively a 30m Fly 
	- Back the incoming 30m behind the zone — Skip-In Start, attack the zone
- Need to simulate racing speed to develop skill-transfer
	- Use Spikes, need an Adequate Run-In
	- Practice Exchanges 1 & 3 on the same turn — practice 2nd separate (another day?)
- Coaching Points — add batons in-hand to the warmup, vary lane-placement in practiceaaa
	- Can time the baton through the zone for efficiency (measure baton through 30m zone)
## Methods of Exchanging the Baton
### Overhand Downsweep Pass (American-Style Pass)
*outgoing has palm to the sky, incoming sweeps down into the hand*
- Formerly used by all US National-Teams, most popular until post-2000
- Advantage: supposed “Free-Distance” by lengthening distance of arms
- Disadvantages:
	- Altered sprint mechanics with long extended-arms (for both runners)
	- If you miss the initial attempt…you’re kinda cooked.
### Push-Pass
*outgoing has palm perpendicular to the ground, thumb down — incoming presses into the palm*
- By far the most popular pass with current US and International Teams
- Advantage: less alteration of sprint-mechanics
- Disadvantage: still altering sprint mechanics with long extended-arm of outgoing
### Underhand Upsweep Pass
*outgoing has palm down, incoming sweeps up into the hand*
- Used by Japan (formerly France, Soviets, and GDR/East-Germany)
- Advantage: maintained sprint-mechanics, safe / “easy”
	- Low palm-down hand is a more stable target
- Disadvantage: “The Shrinking Baton”
	- Must be rotated up in-hand (outgoing gets “wrong end”) — needs high degree of practice
