# The Need for Elastic Training
One of the most fundamental questions to ask when it comes to training exercises is: What
transfer will this movement have to basic athletic skills? 
	Will it help me run faster, jump higher, cut and throw harder, etc.?
	Will it help me to feel more connected and to move more fluidly?
Just because something “produces a lot of force” doesn’t mean that it is going to be in the best
interest of the athlete.
	In a similar manner, just because an exercise is really difficult (as some “functional” training can be), seems to replicate some sport skills, or looks challenging, this doesn’t mean that it is going to be helpful in the end goal of a better moving athlete.
In summary:
- Always ask: “How might this exercise transfer to athleticism”?
- High-force exercises aren’t guaranteed to transfer to high-speed athletic movement
- “Functional” exercises aren’t always as “functional” as we might think they are for athletic performance just because they have a lot of moving parts

### Using too much left brain:
- • High injury rates
- • Burn out
- • Suboptimal mechanics
- • Rigid movement styles
- • Early performance ceiling
### Using too much right brain:
- • Lowered outputs
- • Lack of a consistent, intentional adaptation process
- • Not peaking or tapering optimally, or sustaining one’s gains well
- • Lack of organization in the training program
- • Lack of data to check program results and biases
## The key to athletic performance transfer 
Understanding the principles of movement — on the terms of arches, levers, pressure, and free-energy return.
	It is very helpful to know how to utilize training that can engage a lot of muscle motor units (left brain), but it’s critical and under-looked to understand how to engage the elastic mechanisms of the body more effectively (right brain).
The body in motion as an elastic unit is more than just knowing high-powered exercises and
biomechanical positions.
