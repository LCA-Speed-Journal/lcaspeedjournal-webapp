# Slow Approach to Training Speed
[[Joe DeFranco]] — Westside Barbell / DeFranco’s Gym
- Grew from very small facility (500 ft^2) to where they are now
- Talking about building speed *out of* said facility (plus the parking lot)
## The Prowler
Original use of the prowler was as a conditioning tool (heavy, repeated for high volume)
- Did this for longer than should have been done, used as punishment, challenges, etc.
- Eventually came around to using the prowler more as a power development tool
## The 10yd Start
- Acceleration is everything in team-sports — feeds into Decel/COD too
- 10yd was the distance that worked in the space Joe had
	- High Recoverability, High Carryover, High Intent
	- Building the foundations of explosive strength with a little bit of speed
## Joe’s “Staples” — Indicator-Exercises
Bench — Squat — Chin-Up — Vertical Jump — 10yd Sprint
- Absolute and Relative Strength
- Explosive Power and Speed
## General Ideas on Improving Acceleration
- Improve Strength (relative strength is peak, but also absolute strength)
- Improve Mobility (hip flexors are the big thing, also upper-body to allow big ranges)
- Emphasize power/aggression, not necessarily turnover (high force to cover ground)
## Sleds for Acceleration
- Why: Allows for assisting in proper form — difficult to drag a sled upright, etc.
	- “Slows Down” the accel to allow for more conscious effort into technique
- General Prescription: 3-6s duration per rep (works out to ~10-15yds with a heavy weight)
	- 30-90s rest if pairing with an unresisted sprint (as Contrast Training)
	- Full-Recovery if doing straight-sets, or following the unresisted sprint
- If struggling with athletes looking for thigns to do during rest-interval: Filler-Exercises
	- Hip-Flexor stretching, light activation work, etc.
- Contrast Training works well when used 1x p/wk (can be up to 2x) for a 3-4wk block
