# What’s Important in a Solid Block-Start?
Starts begin at the start of the season.
## Physicality
The foundational piece — have to be physically able to perform the task. 90% of the time, going to start here.
	Often, coaches forget how physical the task is to do well (from angle-perspective)
	Dennis targets this in the weight-room as well as on the track.
Focuses on loading the muscle, not necessarily load. 
	High bias to unilateral work, not a lot of movements are trained past 90°
High volume of sled-pulls, aiming for lower-angles. Long-duration per rep (50-60m).
	Prepares the athlete for drive-phases that need to be a little longer than say, a standard 20m.
	Also *push* sleds, emphasizing the striking pattern (since it cuts down on overstriding)
### First Push out of the blocks (first 15-30m) is “the Drive.”
Dennis doesn’t see as a power-component. That’s built before the tech, thru that setup
Vertical and Horizontal Movement: lower they come out, more power they’re naturally creating. This also means more load on the legs. 
	Can be indicative of strength-deficiency if an athlete comes out high
Dennis tells his athletes to “test the angles.” 
Asks them to shoot low, then just focus on “running away from the block” rather than “powering away.”

> Cueing an athlete low can lead to breaking at the waist, we know this.
> Particularly with young athletes, should be careful about this as a cue.

For those who feel like they’re stumbling when they’re shooting low, like they’re falling forward or off-balance, you need to cycle under faster to hold your balance. 
	Need to meet that low-angle with faster speed underneath.
