# Complementing Speed-Development with RSIST
[[Alex Natera]]
## Primary Benefits
- Protection from ECC-Loading
	- (connects to our need to develop ECC-RFD: see [[Eccentric Forces and Athlete Profiling]])
- Angle-Specific Strength-Development
- Improvements in the Expression of Traditional Strength
	- (Thought — [[Boo Shexnayder]] says that plyos/multijumps do the same thing: ISOs+Plyos enough to totally offset, or ~95%? Or is it still necessary to do *some* modicum of traditional?)
- Architectural Changes in Fasicle Length
- High Stimulus, as well as Rapid Recovery
	- Complementary vs Oppositional
## ISOs and Stiffness
Study: Ankle-ISO (5deg, 5 x 4x3s @ 90%) 4x p/wk, compared to a Hops + Drop-Jumps group
- Saw the improvement of tendon-stiffness with ISOs, and muscle-stiffness with plyos.
> [!QUESTION] [[Plyometric Periodization and Classification|Plyo Programming]] Thought
> Can we pair plyos and ISOs in the same circuit to combine the stimulus? 
> - Would pair non-impact with impact, and both act as pseudo-STR, so hits that too
> - Paired supersets/trisets of 2-3 low-level plyo patterns → a matched ISO, and then take a longer break (~3-5mins)
## Sprinting vs ISOs

## Optimizing Rep-Duration-Reserve
0-3s = 30%
10s = 100%
Past 10s, start to see a drop-off. As such, holds between 3-10s are the most optimal, depending on the quality you’re trying to train.
## Practical Programming
4 Sets: 3x3s with a 2min rest between sets, 3-5s between reps.
