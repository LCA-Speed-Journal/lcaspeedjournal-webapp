# Hurdling Made Simple

## Key Priorities to Developing a Successful Hurdler
“It’s Not Easy, but It’s Simple.”
- Need to Develop Speed — They’re Still Sprinters
	- Hurdle-Training counts as a Speed Day
- Steps — 8-Steps to the first, 3 Steps in between
	- If you can’t get that? Work to get that. Then move on.
- Can you Get Thru the Race Safely? Not Hitting Hurdles, etc.
## Hurdle-Technique and Sprint Training
- Operate as Sprints — Timed, with Spikes
	- Onform App (mentioned from another coach in a different talk
- Understand that Hurdling is More Taxing than Sprinting — another reason to do them *as* Speed
	- You don’t feel like it’s too much until it might e too late.
## Developing Efficient Technique: Focusing on Steps
The main priority needs ot be the 3-Step/8-Step
- 99% of long-hurdle coaching is the stepping — build practices around desired steps
	- Hurdling in practice feels different than in a meet — adrenaline pushes them for more force
	- Discount height / distance in practices to maintain strong technique with good output
	- Alec isn’t afraid to really discount distance to help kids feel a 3-Step
## Technical Drills for Hip Mobility and Efficiency
*Purpose: Hip-Mobility Maintenance, and Muscle-Memory for the Hurdling Pattern*
- Walls / Fence (Lead Leg, Trail Leg)
	- Lead Leg: lowest notch, projecting forward and thru
	- Trail Leg: going as slow as possible, really working the muscles involved
## Lead Leg and Trail Leg Technique Drills
- Walkovers (Lead Leg, Trail Leg) — lowest-notch, six baby-steps to measure between
- Skip-Overs (Lead Leg, Trail Leg)
## Takeoff Step and Cut Step
Cut-Step is the most important thing for projection. 
Alec attests that it’s usually a gradual change — tends to “click” and suddenly make sense
### Key Points to the Cut-Step
- Under the Hip, Joints Stacked
- Not Leading with a Heel
- Proper Distance
## Landing and Trail Leg Technique
### Landing off the Hurdle
- One-Footed Landing
- Arm Action makes a difference – needs to be compact (hands close to body)
- Need to stay bouncy off the ground — collapsing loses you time, and slows you down between
### Over the Hurdle
- Knee leads the way, foot will follow
- Toes: Up and Out (facing down more likely to clip the hurdle and lead to a fall)
## How to Handle an Abridged Season (MN/WI Scheduling)
- Speed training, generally, is okay in the offseason because it isn’t sport-specific
- Thought: First 2-3wks of Sprints-Only, then start pulling into Hurdling 
	- (50:50 split, 2:1 sprints-hurdle, etc.)
- Low-Impact Work can be done as often as every day
