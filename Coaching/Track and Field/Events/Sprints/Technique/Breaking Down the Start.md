# Part 1: Acceleration and Power
## Overview
Chris was reading a [[JB Morin]] article, (cited [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4689850/)) — displacement difference between elites and sub-elites. 
	How fast each athlete gets to the first step.
## Toe-Off / Ankle Stiffness
### Good Characteristics
**Toe-Off:** 
- when toe comes off the ground, there is a delay on the landing with the next foot. 
- The swing leg knee is still moving up. 
**Foot Placement:** 
- Close to underneath center of mass.
## Horizontal Projection

> [!NOTE] Direction of Force
> “An athlete can have all of the hip extension power in the world, but if the ankle is not rigid or the drive in the foot is not forward, they will not accelerate well. Or they will have a poor Drf.

# Part 2: Breaking Down Workouts
## Overview
Contrast Accels, Plyo-Patterns, and Misc. Speed Work. Feels like a Speed + 2x X-Factor week.
A few interesting components here: 
- 2:1 ratio on weighted vs unweighted starts is a good thought. Feels like it belongs in [[Preseason Phase]].
- Using uphill drilling to force continued acceleration makes a lot of sense, we’ve underutilized this.
## Day 1: Contrast Accels (Block-10m Reps)
### **Workout Description:** 2-3 Heavy Accels → Unresisted Accel
When starting, the initial push needs to bring the athlete’s **torso up by driving hips forward.** The push from the back leg should be explosive and powerful. 
	If the athlete pushes from the front, they lose this initial movement that’s so important.
From this movement, the pelvis starts its job in the acceleration. The pelvis of the swing leg needs to start driving up the torso. 
	This is the big difference between runners who have a great start and those who have an average start. 
There should be some **hang time** in the first steps of acceleration. At this stage, if the foot lands too far in front, the hamstring has to do the job of the rectus femoris, and true triple extension will not occur. 
	In fact, this is why some people pull their hamstring coming out of the blocks.

> [!NOTE] Korfist Coaching Cues: The Start
> My coaching cue is **“boom-boom.”** 
> Push from the back foot, and then the front foot. 

> [!NOTE] Korfist Coaching Cues: The Drive Phase
> When the hips drive forward, they create length and space for the foot to land underneath, rather than in front of, the center of mass.
> To further help this, the coach can give a cue to **keep the angle of the knee as acute as possible during the drive phase.** 
> If the coach is watching from the side or assessing film, the *swing leg knee should not stop moving forward before the plant leg’s toe off.*

> [!NOTE] Starting Cues
> When the athlete starts, they focus on **thinking they are like a gazelle.**
> The runner moves the hip up and forward while keeping the swing leg angle between the calf and hamstring tight for as long as possible. The chest should be upright at a 45-60 degree angle. 
> When the leg comes down, the emphasis is to land “behind” the body and drive forward.

## Day 2: Explosion Exercises
### Basic Box Jump
The athlete finds a box that’s about the height of their mid-shin. They put the front leg of their start on the box which is placed off to the side. 
- The athlete should allow as much dorsiflexion as possible and push the hips back. 
	- The amount they bend will depend on how they look in the blocks.
To make this drill more difficult, the coach can place a high box diagonally so the second step has to slam down on top of it and then the athlete can drive from that leg also. 
When they get stronger, they can drop the torso lower.
### Bound Uphill on Moderate Angle
Another drill is to bound up a hill of moderate angle; parking decks have the perfect angle. I like to add some lateral motion as well. 
Focus: hip movement, knee angles, and stepping “behind” the body.
### Good Morning to a Step
I like this drill because it’s similar to a start regarding hip movement. 
Keep the weight light to avoid creating slack or poor drivers.
### Crouch to Stairs
Crouch to stairs is similar to the Good Morning to a step. Start from a bent position and have the athlete work their way up 2 to 3 stairs. 
The key is the hang time when stepping down to the stair.
	It is the “foot from above” principle that allows us not to decelerate when trying to accelerate. (see [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGtblGJOdWQ))
## Day 3: Speed Work
### Fly 10’s with No Arms (for Time)
Do fly 10’s with no arms. I call it “hugs not pugs.” 
This stance forces the athlete to drive to their big toe more. We take time on this as well.
### Single Leg Cleans
To help drive the pattern of fly 10’s with no arms, add single leg cleans to a toe.
### High Knee Skips (Uphill)
High knee skips uphill force the hips to drive the knees up and forward. 
The skip creates tension in the body between knee lifts and allows time to complete the knee action.
### Lateral High Knees (Uphill)
Lateral high knees up a hill are like a Pom line doing the can-can. 
The height of the ramp pushes for high hip movements, and the angle drives to the big toe.
### Daily Toe Pops (Uphill)
To make the drill better, have the athlete keep the ankle rigid on contact. The ankle has to rock forward to create movement. 
When an athlete does a toe pop up an incline, the ankle stays stiff for the landing but must bend forward to move the energy in the body to propel forward. 
The athlete can do one or two legs.
