# Building a Championship Culture — Set, Guide, Anchor
[[Dave Gleason]] — Works with [[+Athletes Acceleration Content]]
## Set the Stage: Global and Specific Expectations
Can set Global Expectations Individually, or as a Group.
	Setting the Tone as a Coach — Establish the Energy in the Room at the top of the session, lead by example.
Specific Expectations — make this fit your unique culture and values. (feels like our [[Parent-Athlete Meeting]] at the start of the season)
- Dave’s Big 4: Listening — Respect — Fun — Effort
- Establish that verbal contract by setting expectations up front with the athletes.
	- Change Delivery depending on Group, ofc. 
	- MS might need a little more reasoning, HS can be a little more simplistic but direct.
## Guide the Session: Using Expectations During Training
Based on the behavior you want to see, **Praise Actions that match** that during sessions. If you take time to focus on it, you’re going to see more of it.
