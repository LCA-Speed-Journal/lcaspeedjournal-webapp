# Elastic Essentials — Bodyweight Training Basics
## Advantages and Disadvantages of Bodyweight vs. Resistance Training
Bodyweight training carries many distinct advantages over barbell based resistance training,
particularly on the level of human function.
	Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each will help a coach to make better decisions about when and how to implement each type of training. 
At the core of this decision is knowing that it is critical to establish a “base of function”, both in terms of an athlete’s career span, and in each training season.

## Bodyweight Training, Complexity and Athletic Adaptation
When it comes to being athletic, this also means being able to handle complex movements, and
process a lot of information well (both internal and external to the body).
	The best athletes are also the best “information processors” relevant to their sport.
When it comes to one’s physical movement battery, the vast majority of movements should be
“complex” in nature. These typically will be performed through the course of performing one’s
sport.
	Sprinting, changing directions, throwing, kicking and doing it all in the context of a moving ball and players on the field is a very complex venture.
### A small amount of work in the training program should be very simple in nature. 
By reducing the total degrees of freedom present in a situation (such as an isometric hold, or a trap bar deadlift) we give an athlete a chance to focus more internally, and on pure outputs, as well as a
chance to directly train the tissues of the body in a new and different way.
### Programming — Linear or Complex
Linear would be something like the following:
- Activate Weak Muscle
- Muscle “Links into the System”
- Improvement in Subsequent Performance
A complex view of training would look at the impact of each exercise in terms of more holistic
movement patterns, as well as the motor control impact that each movement made in training.
### The human body is a system of systems, and not a simple machine. 
There are often more complex elements at play when we consider why an athlete is not moving as well as they would like, or why they might be at a high risk of injury. A “weak gluteus medius”, or a “weak vastus medialis” muscle is often a simple result of a more complex problem issue in the body.
	With this being said, the answer to the “problem” of training an athlete might be more complex in nature, in the sense of us not being able to draw neat lines as to exactly what this training is helping with in terms of the holistic adaptation process.
Humans being complex systems is a core principle behind utilizing the foundational human
movements in a training program. 
	These foundational movements are typically acquired by children who have achieved an adequate amount of play in natural (or perhaps un- natural, such as playground based) environments. 
Each foundational movement utilizes a unique combination of  muscles, and tend to require proprioception and motor control beyond most “corrective” exercises, or simple exercise solutions presented to athletes to help them move and play better.
	These natural movements tend to prove more effective in helping athletes move better, while being more enjoyable. For example, crouch walking can build squat related mobility in a more fun and effective manner than singular squat mobility exercises. There is certainly still room for simple training solutions, but the natural method of complex and foundational movements is a more sustainable practice.
### Human Movements
- Climb
- Hang
- Roll
- Aerial Inversion
- Crouch
- Crawl
- Run/Jump/Throw*
These skills can be referred to as basic “human” level skills. 
When considering the amount of body control, balance, internal information, and velocity present in these skills, we can see that they are more complex in nature than the majority of barbell based exercises presented in a gym setting (outside of perhaps, the Olympic lifts).
- With most non-strength sport athletes (and you could even make the case for strength-sport athletes, such as in Olympic lifting)
	- the best athletes on the team were those who could perform a broader spectrum of these “human” level movements the best
	- (I’m also finding this to be true on the level of working with young athletes, in coaching my 5 year-old daughter’s soccer team). 
- In team sport situations,
	- athletes who could lift the most weight, as well as those who worked the hardest to get bigger and stronger, were not the best athletes in their sport. 
	- Being able to move well on the level of a human being (with one’s bodyweight) matters immensely!
As athletes go from youth, to primary and secondary school, and then up to high-performance
sport and adulthood, the percentage of these movements in a program will change. Kids should
have “human” level training represent 100% of their “training program” (their training program
is really just playing and exploring) and pro or elite athletes should still have some of these
movements present (just in a substantially smaller amount).
## Sample Bodyweight Warmups
Carrying out bodyweight work and patterning for athletes is not difficult, the main rule is just to
start doing it and watch how athletes perform the movements. “Perfect” technique is not nearly
as important as allowing athletes to explore and naturally get better at various skills, the same
way children do! Simply allowing 5-15 minutes at the beginning of a session for athletes to
explore natural movement is a very helpful performance tool to not only prepare the body for
more intense work, but also gain strength in a holistic and robust manner first.
For younger athletes, I’ll tend to do more “human” work, and for more advanced athletes,
generally less.
When athletes are more worn down, I’ll tend to do more “human” work (as well as fun, basic
games), if they are fresh, we often do less.
### Examples of Bodyweight Warmups
(These skills could be done in a sequence, or in a circuit. Athletes can be creative with how they perform the exercises as well, putting their own “spin” on various movements.)

| Series 1     | Series 2              | Series 3    |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Crawling     | Hanging / Monkey-Bars | Crawling    |
| Cartwheels   | Crouch Walks          | Rolls       |
| Crouch Walks | Handstand Holds       | Monkey-Bars |
## Isometric Bodyweight Training
Training with one’s bodyweight goes beyond the more “complex” fundamental human
movements of crawls, crouches, rolls and climbs. 
Bodyweight isometric holds that are simpler in nature help athletes to “zero in” on internal information in their body, and carry with them many benefits, including:
• Positive effect on tendon health
• Improves muscle balance and length
• Helps athletes recover from more intensive work
• Optimizes neuromuscular function of given muscle groups
• Improved proprioception of the utilized muscle groups (in stretch range)
### Styles of Isometrics — Stretch-Range ISOs / Fixed ISOs
Bodyweight isometrics can be used for
- pre-workout “activation” (I generally use more stretch range work here for this)
- “finisher” type stimulus at the end of a training session (If I use “fixed” exercises, they are more often here at the end, such as a standing straight-leg raise).
### Stretch-range isometrics 
ISOs where an athlete is pulling downwards into the stretching range of the movement, while maintaining a vertical torso, and a relatively perpendicular alignment of either the shin (such as in an iso lunge) or the forearms (such as in an iso pushup).
The principle and use of exercises pulling one’s self into an “extreme” end-range position through
a period of time is credited to the work of coach Jay Schroeder, owner of Evo UltraFit.
#### Good Examples
Joel likes to use Stretch-Range ISOs that fall generally into either:
• Lunge position
• Pushup position
Prescription: 2-4 minutes of time for each exercise.
### Fixed isometrics
ISOs where an athlete is trying to simply maintain a position to the best of their ability over the course of time.
Fixed isometrics I’ll use include:
• Standing straight leg raise
• Super-mans and super-man cross crawl holds
• Bar hangs
• Handstand holds
• Straight arm dip holds
Prescription: 2-4 minutes of time for each exercise.

> [!NOTE] A note on Hypermobility
In many of the “straight-arm” movements, hyper-mobile athletes should not be allowed to
hyperextend their elbows, as this is a poor biomechanical practice. It is tough on the joints, and
is ineffective for the nervous system.
Even in “fixed” isometrics, such as a straight leg raise, it’s still helpful to work to lift the free leg as high as one can, during the duration of the movement rather than just staying in one place.
