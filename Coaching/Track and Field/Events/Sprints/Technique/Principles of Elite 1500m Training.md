# Overview
Joe Rubio’s “Principles of Elite 1500m Training” is a systematic breakdown of how to build an elite miler.

It includes training theory on 
- **Key Physiological Demands** of the event
	- **Key Training Paces** are defined, listing key responsibilities of each pace, physiological reference to VO2max, and well as practical application as they would be seen in workout efforts (see also: [[Training Distance Runners, Martin & Coe]])
- Rubio’s model for **how to structure training** (applying and integrating the physiological demands)
	- Rubio’s **Annual Training Plan** is defined, both from a high-level perspective of the primary focus(es) at different phases of the year, as well as specific workouts utilized in each season/phase.
	- **Warmup Theory** is addressed, namely how Rubio integrates the warmup into the workout, separating from the traditional “10-15mins easy, a few strides, BS a little, then do the workout.”
# Key Physiological Demands
## Energy Breakdown for the 1500m
- Aerobic: 76%
- Anaerobic: 22%
- Phosphate (ATP/PCr): ~2%
## Definition of Training Types
### Conditioning Paces
- **Aerobic Conditioning:**
	- easy to moderately paced sustained runs of 30-120 minutes at 55-75% VO2max (the runs that range from a warm-up jog to everyday conversational pace running)
	- This training zone makes up the majority of training most distance runners do within a standard training week. 
- **Anaerobic Conditioning:**
	- 15-25 minute efforts at 75-90% of VO2max (anywhere from slightly slower than marathon race pace down to as fast as 10k race pace)
	- These runs are generally defined as tempo or steady state runs
### Capacity Paces
- **Aerobic Capacity:**
	- 2-8 minute reps at 90-100% of VO2max (generally between 10k/tempo and just faster than 5k pace)
	- These are classically defined as interval workouts or fartlek runs.
- **Anaerobic Capacity:**
	- 30-120 second reps at better than 100% VO2max (generally performed at roughly mile to two-mile race pace for most distance runners)
	- This effort is anaerobic and is considered “speed work” to most. 
## % Breakdown of an Effective Training Plan for the 1500m
- **Conditioning: 65%** — Aerobic (endurance): 45% — Anaerobic: 20% 
- **Capacity: 30%** — Aerobic: 20% — Anaerobic: 10% 
- **Phosphates: 5%**
Put into training terms: 85% of the training comes from aerobic paced training. 
- 45% of this is developed by 30-120+ minute runs finishing the last part at a decent clip, 
- 20% comes from 20-50 minute tempo runs, 
- 20% comes from reps completed at approximately 5k or 10k race pace.

To run a fast mile requires 
- consistently hard 800’s, 
- 1k’s and mile reps, 
- 4-8 mile tempo runs and 
- 12-18 mile runs at uncomfortable paces for the majority of the training year. 
# Training Theory
## Weekly Paces: Training Above/Below
When we have a “primary” training pace, we want to structure our given training week to target the areas just above, and just below. We’ll still have a workout that’s paced appropriate to the primary-pace.
So logically, we have 3 efforts per week: one at primary, one below primary, one above primary.
 - Summer/Fall — the 5k. (Secondaries: Tempo & 3k.)
 - Winter — the 3k. (Secondaries: 5k & 1500m.)
 - Spring — the 1500. (Secondaries: 3k & 800m.)
Rubio also speaks on a bi-weekly schedule, where the training would go 
	±1 pace on Week-1,
	 ±2 paces on Week-2,
 allowing for each block of training to cover the primary pace and the four adjacent paces 1-2x in a training block (going through a full cycle every 6 workouts).
## Training Volume
Rubio believes in setting mileage goals for an athlete at the beginning of the training year, and then deviating only minimally from those throughout the year. 
	Over subsequent years, this mileage will expand, but within a given training year, workouts should split up the reps/sets enough that the total mileage doesn’t exceed an athlete’s given volume. Within this, however, reps can be split up however the coach deems necessary (6x200 can be 4x300, 3x400, etc.)
## Splitting the Effort: One Main Workout
Rubio leans into “one primary effort p/wk,” letting the other workouts serve as maintenance of other qualities. This isn’t to say they’re easy, but the primary workout should be the day of the week that makes the athlete feel a bit nervous.
## Don’t Raise Mileage and Intensity Together
> [!PDF|yellow]- [[middle_distance_guide.pdf#page=44&selection=16,0,66,5&color=yellow| Excerpt: Avoid Raising Mileage and Intensity Simultaneously (Rubio p.44)]]
> > One of the biggest mistakes young runners make is they attempt running new weekly mileage PR’s while also trying to maintain their 2-3 times weekly track sessions.
> > 	They usually crash and burn and later complain that anything over 40 miles a week results in injuries. *Not true.* 
> > 	Trying to raise your weekly mileage while at the same time trying to increase your intensity causes injuries. 
> > 	*Don’t make this mistake.*
> > Stress of any sort needs to be **incorporated slowly enough so that the body can adapt without breaking** (chronic stress vs. acute stress). 
> > Increased mileage and increased intensity are **two different stresses** that need to be adapted to individually. Increasing both at the same time is to be avoided. 
> > 	Start first with the raising the mileage by spending the **summer and early fall months adapting to your new mileage goals** before pushing the limits on the effort of the regularly scheduled workouts. 
> > The scheduled workouts accommodate this added stress of increased weekly mileage by starting out at a very manageable intensity level. Follow these guidelines as they are outlined and **resist the urge to hammer the first few workouts.**
> > Spend the summer and fall getting your legs underneath you before upping the ante on the scheduled workouts. 
> > 	**Once you’ve adapted to the mileage, then it will be time to increase the intensity** with which you run these miles.

# Common Components
![[Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn]]
## Interval-Work
### Fartlek-Style Intervals
- **“Minutes”:** 
  10-25 x 60 seconds on/off. 
- **“NAU” fartlek:** 
  3-8 x 3 minutes on/off. 
  Done every other week. Recovery decreases 30 seconds each successive time this workout is run until the athlete gets down to 1 min. 
- **”Waitz” Fartlek:** 
  1 on/off, 2 on/off, 3 on/off, 4 on/off, 5 on/off, 4 on/off, 3 on/off, 2 on/off, 1 on/off. 
- **”Jane Fonda”** (20 min workout): 
  15 seconds on/off, 30 on/off, 45 on/off, 60 on/off, 90 on/off, 120 on/off, 90 on/off, 60 on/off, 45 on/off, 30 on/off, 15 on/off. 
- **”Wake Forest Drill”:**  performed on a gradual uphill slope of approx. 800m. 
  Up at 5k-10k effort, hit the top, turn around immediately and run the same downhill section at 10-20 second slower. *(Then repeat, i.e. turn around and immediately run uphill at 5k-10k effort.)* 
  Continuous run, up and down = 1 rep. 
  Total workout = 3-8 reps.
- **For those coming off an injury or extended break:** 
  6-10 x 30 second on/90 off or 4-8 x 1 min on/5 off.
### Adam’s State Reps
**Timing:** late-fall, to increase leg turnover for mile reps. In the annual plan, applied for championship-phase for XC
**Rep-Length:** 1500m, on a gradual uphill (preferably dirt)
**Rest:** 3min p/rep
- Uphill rep — 3 min recovery — turn around and focus on running the downhill portion at a fast, controlled pace. 
- Usually ~20s difference between the uphill and downhill portions — *always finish with a faster downhill rep.* 
- The downhill portion is where the athlete learns to run downhills at a faster rate of speed, and do it efficiently.
# Quotes
## Theory: Develop as a “Distance Runner” first

> ([[middle_distance_guide.pdf#page=11&selection=11,0,32,0&color=yellow|Rubio p. 11]])
> We should always start competitive 1500 training by becoming a competitive distance runner first. 
> We must develop the aerobic and anaerobic conditioning aspects as well as the aerobic capacity component to the highest levels possible for the current season and each successive season afterwards before we will see any significant performance gains made by incorporating a large volume of anaerobic capacity work, aka speed-work.
## The True-Base: Following Xmas Break
>([[middle_distance_guide.pdf#page=19|Rubio p.18]])
>Following the small break after XC Fall Nationals is ideally when we start concerning ourselves with the pace of the runs away from the track.
>The 8-10 weeks following the Christmas break is really the true base phase as its classically defined, which means to say it’s all about a higher volume of weekly miles completed at faster aerobic paces approaching 70-75% VO2max. 
>At this point of the training year the athlete should be fully adapted to the weekly mileage goals established 6 months earlier and we can set about fully developing the aerobic and anaerobic conditioning components of the athlete. 
>These will be the building blocks for the real 1500 improvement we will see in the spring and summer. 
>	During the 8-10 weeks of the Aerobic Endurance Phase (1/1-3/1) the pace of most runs should be monitored. 
>	The pace for the last 25% or so of these runs should be completed at 70-75% of 5k fitness. It should not go faster than this, but as much of these runs that should be completed at these paces as possible.
## Aerobic Paces
**Recovery Pace:** should be no faster than 65% of your 5k pace at any point in this run (usually in the low to mid 60% range is what we want). 
	If you allow 6+ hours between sessions, doing one of these easy recovery runs in the AM and another in the PM is fine and within the definition of a recovery day if you’d like to maintain double days within the schedule.

# Rubio’s Extended Warmups (p. 45-46)
## Main-Ideas
The main ideas of Rubio’s extended warmups are 
- Begin the workout with a **moderate run** (either straight or progressive).
- From there, the warmup gets **faster and faster**, funneling towards the workout pace, doing things like 
	- Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn into more focused efforts
	- Strides into some progressive accelerations.
## Specific Warmup Protocols
### Warmup A: All-Out, 400, 800, or Mile Workouts
1. 20 min progressive run (10 min easy, 5 at AE, 5 at tempo)
2. 1200-1600 of stride the straight/jog turn
3. 1 x 150-200 at 1500 pace
4. 1 x 150-200 at 800 pace
5. 1 x 150 acceleration (1500/800/400)
6. 1 x 150 Sprint/Float/Sprint (400/800/400)
7. 5-10 minutes, then proceed with scheduled workout.
### Warmup B: 5k, 10k, or Tempo Workouts
1. 25-30 min easy
2. 4 x 80-100 light strides
3. 6-8 x 120 diagonal accelerations (1500/800/400) on grass field, walk across recovery
4. 5-10 minutes, then proceed with workouts.
