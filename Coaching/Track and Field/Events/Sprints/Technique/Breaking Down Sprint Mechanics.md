# Breaking Down Sprint Mechanics
[[Jonas Dodoo]] – [[Speedworks]] and [[VueMotion]]
## Connecting the Dots ([[PSR Model]])
- Projection — Horizontal orientation of movement, how much hip extension do you use to do it?
	- Foot PUSHING Behijnd the Hip
- Switching — Rapid backwards-attack with the front-thigh while back punches forward
	- In-Air Repositioning
	- High Thigh-Angular-Velo
- Reactivity —Limited drop/sinking around hip/knee/ankle when on ground, fast GCT
## Whip From the Hip
(as [[Ken Clark]] and [[Peter Weyand]])
To punch hard, need enough room to acceleratie (thigh-angle needs to be high enough)
- Shortens at the hip, lengthens at the knee (helps minimize strain)
## Hamstring Injury Factors
(same study from JB Morin’s references in [[Training Acceleration and Assessing Sprint-Mechanics]])
- Lumbo-Pelvic Control —  influences load-transference to the hamstrings due to the anatomical connection between pelvis and hamstrings
- Anterior Pelvic Tilt — lengthens the proximal hamstrings, putting them under higher strain
- Forwards Trunk Lean — Increases hamstring-length at stance (higher strain), also may lead to more compensations including pelvic-tilt, overstriding, and higher hip-extensor moments
- Trunk Lateral Flexion — alters the lever-arms of the trunk, which reduces stability at pelvis
- Maximal Hip-Flexion Angle — Greater angle increases distance (higher angular accel and higher vGRF), but may also increase tissue length, peak forces, and negative work. 
	- Seems like a paradox between performance (need good hip-flexion) and injury (can’t have so much that it’s a problem)
- Back-Side Mechanics — Increases length of hip-flexors with subsequent pelvic-impacts and stretch of the contralateral hamstring
- Overstriding — higher Peak-Braking, increases demands on the hamstring to reaccelerate the COM
## Performance: What Correlates?
### 0-10m Times
- **Thigh-Angular Velocity** — the biggest KPI for 0-10m
- Thigh separation range — not as a big a deal
- Step-Frequency — not a big deal
- Hip Displacement — not as big a deal
### Step Characteristics
- Step Length: Most Correlated with step-frequency (negative relationship)
	- Not as much with separation, punch, and airtime
- Step Frequency: GCT correlated to both frequency and touchdown distance
- Thigh Angular-Velo: correlated with thigh-separation and thigh-punch
	- Not as much with thigh push, GCT, touchdown, or frequency
### Linking Correlations to the PSR System
#### Projection
How far can you travel forwards, yes, but also looking at separation and punch, as well as push
#### Switching
How well can you *rip* the legs through (early extension attack-velo, early flexion attack-velo)
#### Reactivity
Looking at touchdown distance and GCT (good spot to minimize braking and set yourself up better to push)
## Athlete Variability
Coming back to [[James Wild]]’s Quadrant system (finally have a cited paper of his from 2018, *Differences in step characteristics and linear kinematics between rugby players and sprinters during initial sprint acceleration*)
Looking at Coefficient of Variation (SD/Mean * 100) of less than 10% within athletes
- Constrained to within same days, rep-to-rep
- Change above typical variability (> 1x CV) will have significant impact on success, with an even greater impact when the change is > 2x CV
### Quadrants
1. Quadrant 1: Length + Air-Time
2. Quadrant 2: Length + Ground-Time
3. Quadrant 3: Frequency + Ground-Time
4. Quadrant 4: Frequency + Air-Time
