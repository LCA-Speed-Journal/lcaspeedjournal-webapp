- Common Team-Sport Flaws
	- Flexed Posture or Backside-Dominant. Usually fix with dribbles, but PVC Sprints can also fix the former.
- Mechanics
	- Need fast foot into the ground, also need fast foot off the gorund. Either of these gets slow, bad things happen.
- Slice vs Stomp
	- "Slice, don't stomp. Too many drills focus on stomp-like behavior (A-Skips, High-Knees), can reinforce a pattern we don't want.
	- Stomping is too vertical, does not propel as well."
- Why Can't Get to the Big Toe
	- No Foot Rotation,
	- No Ankle Rotation,
	- No Thigh Rotation,
	- No Torso Stability
