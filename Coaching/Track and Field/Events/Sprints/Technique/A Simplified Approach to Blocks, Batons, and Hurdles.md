# The 4x100m Relay
*As Tony says: “The Pissing Contest of Track Coaches”*
- Train a group of 8, not a group of 4 — build out alternates, a “squad” rather than just four runners
## Lane-Ownership
Athletes need to share the lane for a good handoff (inside and outside)
- Allows for a little bit of wiggle-room in a tight-exchange — incoming can overrun without getting in the way of the outgoing
## Drilling Handoffs
- Jogging Handoff Drill — Run on either side of the line, jogging approach, practice hand positions
	- Stop-Sign and Candlestick
	- Can practice Bang-Step at lower speeds to practice the foot-down when incoming hits zone
- One Perfect Handoff — not going for (x) amount of reps, going for one perfect rep
	- Puts pressure on the athletes to execute well, keeps intent high, and mimics competition
# Starting Blocks
Tony believes that acceleration is important, but MaxV is king.
	(stands in contrast to [[Chris Korfist]], who leans more on acceleration for speed-development)
- Block-Starts can be done as supplemental volume at the end of practice — not very fatiguing
- Shin angles dictate where the athlete goes
	- Don’t be too high, will pop up — Don’t be too low, might stumble or will break at waist
- Eyes need to be “seeing the track” — gaze down, keep head in line with spine
	- Eyes up leads to head up, leads to popping up
- Easiest place to start — 2-Feet and 3-Feet
	- Once you’re getting into the more intermediate guys, use Korfist’s measuring via leg-length
- [[Boo Shexnayder]] recommends pressing the middle of the back-foot against the top of the pedal
- [[Stu McMillan]] of [[Altis]] says to think about “punching the front knee forwards”
## Learning What *Not* to Do
- Don’t keep the hands flat against the ground — need some kind of bridge with the hands
	- Makes it harder to leave the ground with a more flat contact-point
- There needs to be more of a vertical component for developmental athletes, when compared to advanced sprinters
	- Don’t “stay low” coming out of the blocks, because it leads to breaking at the waist
- Beware of huge split — can lead to overextending of the front leg
	- leads to shin-cast and stepping down rather than striking back to keep momentum FWD
- Don’t lift from the foot, will lead to early cycling 
	- Foot needs to be low (*not* toe-drag low, but needs to be low)
- Don’t try too hard, don’t think too much — both are qualities of slow athletes
	- Train the aspects that benefit speed (stiffness, switching, etc.) and let the athlete perform
# Acceleration Drills
- Partner Pushes
- MB Throws
- 10m Hill-Sprints
- Wall Drill
- Resistance Bands
- Sleds
# Hurdles (see [[+Hurdles Training]])
- Objective #1: FIND THE HURDLERS
	- A bad track program has no hurdlers — vice versa for good programs
	- Similar outlook for triple jump — indicator of a good program
- Teach the 3-Step first — if they can’t do it, they shouldn’t hurdle in a meet
- Discount the Height, Discount the Distance
- Do Low-Impact Drills daily (see [[Alec Holler]] and his series)
- Quality, never Quantity — spiked-up, only over 1 or two
	- Never hurdling when tired
- Lead-Leg should be back in the blocks (otherwise you’re 7-stepping to the first)
- Lead with the knee, not with the foot
- Need an aggressive hip-position (hip should project forward past the cut-step to launch FWD)
- Emphasis on the cut-step (step right before the hurdle is a touch short)
- Don’t get too close to the first hurdle (7ft for boys, 6.5 for girls)
	- HS athletes love to get too close to feel more safety in clearing the hurdle
- “Show the athlete video without coach-commentary — let them respond and ask for guidance”
