## The Three Big Concepts of Scaling
### People: Staffing and Leadership
“Find the **right people**, not the best people.” –Jack Ma
You can always teach people to coach. Personality, Work Ethic? Those are the real questions.
- Internships: great way to find the right people who have the right personality and work ethic.
	- Would you go out for a drink with this person? Would you leave your kids with them? Could your parents have a good conversation with them? Are they teachable?
	- Need a place to find interns? Partner with local Universities, they’ve usually got people, particularly if you reward with class-credits
	- Coaching everyday, formal education sessions daily, [[CFSC+]] Seminars, workout with the coaches daily, plan for the career of the intern
“The Growth and Development of People is the highest calling of leadership.” –John Maxwell
- Lead from the Front: can’t sit on the sidelines and be a leader, you need to mirror the behaviors you want to see. Your own actions impact your staff larger than words can.
- Regular Staff Meetings: the Centerpoint of Communication.
	- Client Check-Ins, New Ideas, Book-Club, Weekly Housekeeping
	- Give Everyone a Voice: allow everyone to feel like they’re part of the process. Trial and Error as a Team.
- Retaining Staff = Retaining Clients.
	- People you lose too soon are the people you don’t check in with.
	- You won’t keep everyone, but you maximize their value by making sure they’re happy and growing.
### Systems: Principles and Programming
#### Principles
“Be firm on Principle, but Flexible on Method.” –Zig Ziglar
- Know your System: write out your model, have a clear understanding of your principles, and teach daily.
- Build a Commercially Friendly Model: what can you *realistically* deliver in 60mins?
	- Build systems that support your philosophy inside the constraints of your model (eg. 10 people p/group, 15mins p/session)
- Logistics are always your limiting factor: space, equipment, coaching skill, group size, time, frequency, training window. You can only program for what you have.
	- Set things up in advance, have a daily plan and understand what pieces need to be prepared.
- Training is a Recipe, not a Menu: running a good facility relies on your team to provide a unified approach to programming, coaching, and education.
	- [ ] 📅 2025-10-07 : [[The Checklist Manifesto]]
	- Checklists reduce error, take the burden of thinking away, export your brain to staff through an SOP.
	- Write out flow-charts of progression/regressions, standardized workout plans, etc.
#### Programming
“A Program doesn’t need to be complicated to be effective.”
- Aim for 2-3 day, Full-Body programming. Advanced can do 4-5x p/wk with something like an upper/lower.
	- Warmup and Prep
	- Power (Jumps, Hopping, Bounding, Throwing)
	- Explosive
	- Push—Pull—Knee-Dominant—Hip-Dominant—Core—Condition
- Gen-Pop Work: 12 x 4wk programs with shifting focus (ISO, ECC, Tempo, Intensity, Volume, Density, etc.)
	- 1-4 Sets of 5-20 Reps. Aim for minimum effective dose, allow for individual specificity.
- Periodization: doesn’t need to be complicated. 8→10→12, 6→4→2, etc. Small load changes over time.
	- Stimulus, Response, Adaptation, Repeat.
- Progression: volume, intensity, load position (goblet, zercher, etc.), support (bilateral, unilateral, etc.), tempo
- Density: non-competing pairings (antagonistic supersets, tri-sets, etc.)
- Exercise-Selection: always go for “what could go wrong.” What can the majority of your group do well?
- Give the Illusion of Choice: “do you want to bike, run, or push a sled today?”
### Execution: Client Relationships and Coaching
“People Don’t Buy What You Do, They Buy Why You Do It.” –Simon Sinek
10/5 Rule: within 10ft, smile and make eye contact — within 5ft, verbally greet/engage
- Teaching 101: 
	- 30s or Less, give 3 great demos (right, wrong, right)
	- Position, Action, Feel
	- Speak Plainly, Ask for Confirmation, then Let them Try It.
