# Top-Speed Training
[[Ken Clark]] — West Chester University
## The Science of Top-Speed
By 20m, almost all athletes (including pros) are ~90% of maxV. Peak Velocity (maxV) can be as late as 40-70m, but upright mechanics may begin as early as 16-18m.
	Training Implications: will be training upright mechanics even when the sprint is 20-30m — just differing with regards to the amount of *time* spent utilizing those mechanics
### Distinguishing Characteristics of Phases
**Start (0-2 Steps)**:
	longest GCT, shortest flight-times, forward-leaning posture, and a forward-angled vector
**Transition (5-20m, Steps 3-13ish)**: 
	intermediate GCT and flight-time, posture/vector getting upright
**Top-Speed**: 
	short GCT, longer flight-times, upright posture and vertical force-vector
### Ground-Contact Geometry
Force *tangent* to the ground, not necessarily just vertical force, is the big thing to think about
	This means that the angle of attack, and the angular momentum are also big factors in 
#### Terms
- Contact-Excursion Angle: Total Angle swept by the leg during the ground-contact phase
	- Usually 50-60deg, or 1rad
- Contact Distance: foward distance traveled by the COM during the ground contact phase
	- Usually ~ leg length (1m)
#### GCT and Running Speed
- Speed = Contact Distance / Contact Time
	- since contact distance is generally the same, faster speeds are correlated with shorter contact times
(Sidebar: not necessarily good to aim for super short, can be a problem if the athlete isn’t actually pushing to create the necessary propulsion to carry themselves forward, particularly in acceleration)
- Vertical Impulse: Avg. Vertical Force * Contact Time
	- Can increase impulse by staying on ground longer (potenttiaal compensation strategy), or by imparting more force into the ground (the way to go if we want to increase speed)
- Faster Speed largely connected to a greater *rate* of vertical force application
	- Greater spike in the initital component of contact 
	- (Connected to ankle stiffness: striking ground hard with an efficient amount of return, not letting the ankle mush and imparting all force into the ground rather than absorbing through collapse)
#### Thigh Angular Motion (Angular Velocity and Angular Acceleration)
Comparing thigh angular motion between team-sport and elite sprinters:
- oscillation is more symmetrical: team-sport has more backside-ROM
- increased amplitude, particularly on the flexion-side (more front-side)
- faster frequency, and a sharper angular acceleration
*(Cue the **Clark-105**, as popularized by [[Cal Dietz]])*
Two Mass Model shows us that the lower-leg has a separate impulse from the  rest of the body, and a higher impulse with this “whipping” of the lower-leg is connected to higher max-velocities
#### Fast Top-Speed Equation
Fast Thigh Angular-Velo → Fast Foot-Touchdown Velo + Stiff Ground Contact → High Rate of vForce
#### Top-Speed Mechanics: Bounce, Scissor, Strike
- Runner should appear to “Bounce” so there’s enough lift to attack the ground
- Legs should aggressively “Scissor” with a rapid reversal
- Front-Leg should forcefully “Strike” the ground
- We need Torsional Stiffness during Flight-Phase, and Vertical Stiffness on Contact
## Practical Applications
### Technical Application
#### Differences: Sprinters vs Team-Sport
- **Posture**: Upright/Neutral versus pelvis-collapse and rotation
	- First Rule of Sprinting — Posture, Posture, Posture
- **Legs**: Less Backside Swing, More Front-Side Lift for the sprinter
	- Want to minimize the swinging of the leg behind the body — Shift thigh-ROM toward front
	- Want to see a powerful recovery out in front — strong knee-lift to allow attack-angle
- **Landing**: Attacking from Above vs Casting Out + Passive-Landing
	- Aggressive striking underneath the hips
	- Hitting with ball-of-foot, aiming for a neutral ankle upon impact
	- Contact shin should be near-vertical with knees together at touchdown
	- Should be stiff from the ground up into the torso
	- No Collapse through Ankle/Knee (Sagittal-Plane) or in the Hip (Frontal-Plane)
		- Hip-Dip can be indicative of Glute-Med weakness (see [[Chris Korfist]] guidelines)
- **Misc:** strong arm-drive from the shoulder, synchronized with the legs
#### Should Team-Sport Athletes Look like Sprinters at Top-Speed?
Complicated topic — obviously they aren’t going to look *identical* at top speed, because they have a different set of constraints with their sport rather than just the linear aspects of the sprinting
	Rarely will look exactly like sprinters, but should aim for positions that are closer to *resembling* sprinters if they want to have higher top-speeds.
### Drilling and Exercises to Improve Top-Speed
*Pro-Tip: “Sneak In” some tech-work during a Dynamic Warmup*
#### Switching-Drills
(Booms, Boom-Series, etc. as [[Tony Holler]] and [[Chris Korfist]] would call them)
- In-Place Switching as well as Translating Forward
- Reminder: Thigh doesn’t need to get higher than 90deg
#### A-Series: 
(well known, yeah, everyone does them) 
- Focus on sharp GCT and Posture
- Variations: Hands-Overhead, Arms-Out, Holding a MB, etc.
#### Dribbles: 
Ankle, Calf, Knee
- Focusing on striking down and thinking about where foot-contact is happening
- Great way for team-sport athletes to get a feel for striking on ball-of-foot
- Variations: (as A-Series, varying hand-positions or holding implements)
#### Prime-Times:
Shuffling, Running, Bounding
- Don’t lean, want a vertical posture as we sweep into the ground
- Great for helping athletes unlearn large backside-ROM
	- Variations: (as A-Series and Dribbles)
#### Sprint-Bounding (submax and maximal-effort)
- Focusing on pushing through the ground, thinking about “up and out”
- Starting sub-max helps athletes learn *how* to push, before moving into maximal
- Starting with a lateral plyo (skater-jumps, etc) can be great to prime the pushing action of these
#### Flying Sprints
3-4 Reps, focusing on a single quality per rep
	a. Output (max-effort fly, just ripping it)
	b. Posture (running tall, making sure hips are up)
	c. Leg-Recovery (“everything in front")
	d. Ground-Contact (punchy, sharp into the ground)
Traditionally using at least 20yd (or m) build, and allowing for a similar length on the decel
Technical Flys: 95% effort or so, “taking the edge off” or operating at slightly less than top-speed
#### Wickets
Improving form at high speeds — effective for track, we know, but also can be used for team-sport
[[Vince Anderson]] has a good protocol for wicket-spacing and accel-ladders
- Note: Team-Sport takes a little more time to learn the technique for these appropriately
### General Training Recommendations
*Specific recommendations obviously depend on the athlete, the sport, the training cycle*
- Top-Speed Days: 1x p/wk at a minimum
	- Prep-Drills
	- Technical Build-Ups *or* Wickets: 3-4 Reps (30-40m p/rep)
	- Max-Speed Reps (timed): 3-4 Reps (40-50m p/rep, can push to 60m)
- In-Season (Team-Sport Practices): Incorporate Speed-Training into the Warmup
	- 3-4 Movement Drills → Short Accelerations (3-4 reps)
