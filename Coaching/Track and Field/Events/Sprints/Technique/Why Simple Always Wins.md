# Why Simple Always Wins
[[Nicole Rodriguez]] — EXOS
## Big Ideas
Simple does not mean easy — clear and concise, get to the point, but be excellent.
## The 3 Buckets at EXOS
- Position — Root Skills, Fundamental Strength in various body-positions, etc.
- Pattern — Coordination and Body-Awareness
- Power — Neural Outputs
### How to Determine Who Belongs to What Bucket?
Vertical Jump Profile is the big assessment used at EXOS. 
- Non CMJ, CMJ, Depth Jump (40cm Box)
	- Should see 5-15% increase from Non-CMJ to CMJ — EUR
- Men should be 26”, Women should be 19” — Nicole’s Thresholds, not EXOS-Specific
## EXOS Session Outline
- Pillar Prep — address individual needs (3-7mins), takes the most buy-in
- Movement Prep — address needs of the session (skills, etc.)
- Movement Skills — efficiency and specific strength (Med-Ball work, etc.)
- Strength and Power — supporting movements used in the activity
- Energy System Development — metabolic stress / conditioning
- Regeneration — self-care
## Big Questions
- What are the tools you actually use?
- What are the tools you’re really comfortable with leveraging?
## What do the athletes (or each athlete) need?
- Movement
- Mindset
- Nutrition
- Recovery
The job of the coach: how to blend the pillars together and individualize to what each athlete needs
## On-Field Practical
- Split-Drop into Acceleration — not immediate accel. Drop, switch (1-2x), then out
	- Practice-Application: splitting on either side, then however many switches (even or odd) to get to desired stance, before taking off
	- Need to drop down with enough split-weight to make a fast switch, but not so upright in the torso that the take-off into the accel is going to be slow
- Wall-Drill can be used to teach hip-projection
	- similar to [[Hurdle Drills Explained|Hurdle-Drill]], where we want hips projecting past the stance-foot
	- Could pair this with a partner-support to take people off the wall and into a cluster
- Heavy Sled-Walks — teaching forward lean and the strength of our extension
	- Keeping our lean through the whole rep, positive shin-angle and floating-heel
	- The slower you go, the harder the pattern — faster means less friction p/step
