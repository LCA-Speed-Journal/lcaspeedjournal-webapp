# An Overview of Texas A&M Sprint Practices
[[Vince Anderson]] — Texas A&M
- Was at the Carleton Sprints Camp — good-energy coach, extremely emphatic at times, but incredibly passionate
## Training Phases
Early-Season is a lot of teaching, not as much “going” — as the year progresses, the teaching becomes less dense as athletes are starting to just perform
- Understand that a normal weekly template needs to shift — understand the importance of restoration weeks (spread out the density) and deload weeks (post hard-meets, etc.)
## Early-Season (Fall)
Start with high-intensity work right out of the gate, just limiting total volume to shorter distances
### Accel-Days (Mon)
Short Accels with MB Pass or other resistance
Short Accels from a 3pt (in flats) — still high-intensity
Longer Accels on Grass (50m or so) — high-intensity, but sub-max (400m intensity or so)
Warmdown Series with hurdle-mobility and marching run
Finish with Strength-Training
### Tempo-Days (Tue)
250s at 84% of 200m best (long-sprints get one more rep than short-sprints)
Longer Accels from a Crouch (50s or so)
Warmdown with Barefoot Running on Grass and hurdle-mobility
### Active-Recovery / General Strength Days (Wed)
Shorter warmups, standing broads, MB throws, strength-training
### Intensive-Tempo (Thu)
### MaxV Days (Fri)
3-4 Runs for MaxV
Broken 300s (2x150s on Grass)
Warmdown with barefoot runs on grass, hurdle mobility, etc.
## Mid-Season (Winter)
### Accel-Days
Starting to add spikes in, building distances out to 30s and 40s
	Long-Sprints group starting to add race-modeling work for 400 things (80s, 115s on the curve, 50s with short rest, etc)
### Tempo-Days
Building out to things like tempo 200s, 300s, etc.
### Active-Recovery / General Strength
less of the broads, more of the general strength and things like Med-Ball work
### Accel #2 (Thurs)
Contrast Sprints in play now (on the straight or on the curve)
### Tempo #2 (Fri)
## Late-Season (Spring)
### Transitional Day (Mon)
Segment runs on Grass — progressive across the interval (150m could be 50m at 30” pace, 50m at 28” pace, 50m at 26” pace, or could be 75m at 30” and 75m at 26” pace)
### General Strength (Tue)
### Acceleration / Intensive Tempo (Wed)
Group 1 did accel (30, 50, 70m from blocks), group 2 did intensive tempo (3x200 with 5’ rest in flats)
### Regeneration Day (Thu)
### Pre-Comp (Fri)
## Acceleration Tangent
“There’s no such thing as the drive phase. The *entire race* is the drive phase.”
Think about the entire race as a continued pushing. 
The phases of the race exist, yes, but only from the perspective of biomechanics. 
	Within the body of the athlete, it comes down to aggressive pushing: the whole time.
