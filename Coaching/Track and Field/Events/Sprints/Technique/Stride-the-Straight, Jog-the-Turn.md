### Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn
These are used at multiple points in the training year, they just depend on pacing. 
- Summer: Not Leveraged 
- Fall: Speed-Maintenance, with Higher Volume
	- Early-Fall: Speed-Maintenance with Higher-Volume
		- Ex. 2400m — Untimed Strides, but based on efforts. First few @ 3k, middle ones @ Mile, last 1-2 @ 800m
	- Late-Fall: Speed-Maintenance Work
		- Ex. 1200m — 2 @ 3k, 2 @ Mile, 2 @ 800m
- Winter: Speed-Maintenance Work
	- Early-Winter: Speed-Maintenance
		- Ex. 1200m — 2 @ 3k, 2 @ Mile, 2 @ 800m
	- Late-Winter: Speed-Maintenance.
		- Ex. 1200m — 2 @ 3k, 2 @ Mile, 2 @ 800m
		- Ex2. 1400m – 4 @ 3k, 3 @ Mile
- Spring: Warmup-Component
	- On Speed-Focused days (400, 800, 1500 paced). 
	  The intermediate step between the progressive opener and more rep-oriented cutdowns to end the warmup.
They seem to be Rubio’s version of progressive strides, but encapsulated into a more continuous effort.
> [!TIP]- Comparing to [[Jay Johnson]]’s Strides-Progression
> Rubio’s StS, JtT feels similar to Jay’s method of frequently doing strides as “surges” within longer runs.
> Rubio’s are set at the length of the straight, while Jay’s have a more variable progression based primarily on time. 
> Overall, Rubio’s give amuch more structured approach, while Jay’s are more by feel.
> Jay’s might work better when we’re doing longer runs on the road, Rubio’s might work better when we’re on the track.
