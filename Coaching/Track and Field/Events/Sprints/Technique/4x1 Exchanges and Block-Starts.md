# 4x1 Exchanges and Block-Starts

## Lane Ownership
- Stand 2 Guys Shoulder-to-Shoulder in the same lane — there’s enough room
- Lane-Position — Curve Runners on the Inside, Straightaways on the Outside
	- Inside: Right Hand — Outside: Left Hand
## Bang Step and Takeoff Techniques
- Problem with “when he hits the tennis ball, you go” — Go is inconsistent
	- Speed of the turn, reaction, speed of the takeoff, etc.
- Bang Step uses 2-Tennis Balls — incoming inside the zone, outgoing 1st step is *down* on the track
	- 20, 24 steps is the “starting zone” — adjust due to speed differences (could be 16-20)
	- Faster Incoming Runner, might need to push the zone back a step or two
## Drive Phase and Baton Timing
- First 10m is just to drive — big and strong, pushing, not worried about arm
	- What used to be the big triangle no longer exists, otherwise that would be the mark
- Younger athletes get too concerned about  the hand and forget to actually drive out
## Baton Exchanges
Outgoing: Stop-Sign
- Thumb is Down, never want hand to the sky, want a nice big target
- Low hand is a death-trap, means the incoming needs to strike down (one shot, or you’re done)
- Don’t ever go fishing for the baton — keep stable target, let incoming adjust on their end
Incoming: Candlestick
- Upright, 6 to 12
- Pushing into the hand of the outgoing — no reaching, you lose your speed
## Setting the Mark to Master Exchanges
- When Field-Events Start (during the 4x800) — do a perfect exchange in the zones
## Tips for Practicing High-Speed Handoffs
- High-Speed Handoffs on Speed Days
	- e.g. doing 40yd Flys — 1-2 Reps with everyone, then relays split off
	- Pulling the relay guys encourages others to be good enough in the relay group
- Handoff Drill — low-intensity, can do basically at any point
	- Jog with an outgoing with hand back, incoming focuses on getting into position and pushing into the receiving hand
## Order Strategy and Team-Dynamics
- Big-Guys generally work better on the straightaways
- Anchors are the most competitive
- Best 2 Guys are on the straightaways — strongest on the 2nd
- 2nd and 3rd leg are unique because they need to both give/receive — reliability
- Be willing to change the order, develop an 8-man relay group
- Value the opinions of the athletes — they understand their personalities, and builds buy-in
## Other Recommendations for Effective Relay Training
- Develop strong Fresh-Soph relay athletes — investing in the future, builds strong culture
- Record the splits of the relays — doesn’t tell you everything
	- Record the baton, not the guy
