# Training the Feet for Reactive Power
Training the lower leg and foot is often times, watered down into either simply training muscles, or going barefoot, but not approaching the actual sensations one has while barefoot.
- Movement is powered by muscles, that help set up joints, that can then harness the power of the connective tissues (fascia and tendons) to provide propulsion.
- This entire process is controlled by the nervous system on an unbelievably precise level, far beyond what our best super-computers are capable of.
By looking at movement holistically, we can better understand how to approach the foot.
- The foot and lower leg of humans (and especially fast animals) is dominated by connective tissue, relative to muscles around the hip.
Fascia is the “saran wrap” of the body, a giant interconnected web that knits the body together.
- It provides even more strength to a series of joints than muscle can, by a principle known as tensegrity.
	- To understand tensegrity, think of how a dinosaur’s long neck can be supported by the “cable system” of connective tissues that runs along the span of bones (the neck couldn’t be supported by only the muscles pulling on the bones!)
## Arches and Domes: The Strongest Structure Meets Natural Design
The foot can be incredibly strong against resistance, because it is actually a series of arches, that form two half- domes. The foot doesn’t just use “muscle” to support weight, but the principles of tensegrity (the power of connective tissue) and geometry (the power of shapes).
The foot has three arches:
• Medial
• Lateral
• Transverse
These arches form natural “domes” out of the bones of the foot that can support an incredible amount of force. Domes are the strongest structure in all of nature, and is an important part of how the foot can help athletes to run fast, jump high, and move explosively while working against gravity.
The arches of the foot forming correctly is more important than making a muscle strong in the
foot. So far, with all of this considered, we have the following important points regarding training
the foot and lower leg:
• Muscles help to set up joints to connect into elastic power
• Elastic power is maximized through principles of tensegrity
• The foot needs to be trained prioritizing geometry (it’s arch and dome nature) to help
manage the force of gravity
When the foot is trained properly from youth (not deprived of sensation), onwards, and exposed
to enough explosive movements, it will tend to form a shape that represents a high level of
tensegrity. 
This idea of this natually-occuring athletic foot shape was discovered and popularized
by foot and fascia expert Chong Xie.
An athletic-shaped foot has curled toes and prominent extensor tendons, as well as a prominent
anterior tibialis tendon. This should not be confused with toes that are curved or curled due to
overly gripping the ground, which happens when the tripod and metatarsal head pressure of the
foot is not well established. Toes gripping down is also typically present in those athletes with a
prior injury history in one, or both legs.
## Pronation/Supination: “Mobile Adaptor / Rigid Lever”
We need to understand how the foot works as both a “mobile adapter” (pronation) and “rigid
lever” (supination), as I’ve heard termed by Gary Ward. 
We need to understand both the ability of the foot to “unlock” and load the body with energy via internal rotation, and then to “lock” and become a rigid lever by which to push off of.
### Pronation
Pronation is simply the flattening of all three arches of the foot, accompanied by a cascade of
internal rotation that happens up the kinetic chain. When an athlete pronates:
• Arches of the foot flatten
• The foot dorsiflexes (points up towards the face)
• The calcaneus/heelbone everts
• The tibia and femur internally rotate
Pronation is associated with internal rotation and also compression. Compression helps an
athlete to reverse momentum in a squatting-oriented situation. 
This is why, for vertical movements, such as the reversal of a hurdle hop, or a natural squat (where an athlete chooses a narrow to medium width stance), there will be pronation and the knees coming in to various degrees (individualized to the athlete) as the athlete reverses the movement.
### Supination
Supination uses the opposite actions of pronation, with the three arches of the foot rising, and a
cascade of external rotation. Supination features:
• The three arches of the foot rising
• The calcaneus everting
• The foot plantar-flexing
• A cascade of external rotation up into the body
Supination is associated with external rotation and expansion of the body. 
When an athlete is performing an activity where they don’t want much deformation in the body (think of jumping off of one leg, or upright sprinting relative to acceleration), then they will be working in a more supinated overall state, relative to being pronated. They are more expanded than contracted.
This, of course, does not mean that there won’t be pronation in some of these more expanded
activities, the amount of pronation, and the total amount of arch flattening, will simply be limited.
## Forefoot-Rearfoot Opposition and Heelbone Eversion
One “unlikely” element of good foot function, as far as people think to look, is heelbone
(calcaneus) eversion. The calcaneus will evert and anteriorly tilt, and this, coupled with tibial
internal rotation, to unlock spiraling power in the lower leg.
Often times, those with “stuck” heelbones are at increased risk of lower leg injuries, such as Achilles tendonosis.
The moving calcaneus helps to keep the Achilles tendon from getting over-stretched, and can buffer forces moving up into the body.
### Methods to help with basic rearfoot mechanics
• Using wedges (particularly those made by Gary Ward) to help teach the calcaneus to
move
• PVC Pipe training
• Slant-board Hops
• Multi-direction single leg jumps
## Achilles Tendon Dynamics
The lower leg and foot have loads of connective tissue and tendons running through them. The most powerful tendon in the lower leg (and the whole body for that manner) is the Achilles tendon.
You can see the timing of the Achilles tendon in any athletic movement, by watching it “thicken” as it loads with energy, and then “thin” as force is unloaded.
Athletes who have trouble timing the unloading of the Achilles tendon (and even those who don’t) can benefit from various heel tapping exercises to help an athlete sync up the timing mechanisms in the lower leg.
## Training Foot / Lower Leg: Awareness, Proprioception and Levers
Training the foot happens in three main steps:
• Activating the arches of the foot
• Bathing the foot in sensation (proprioception)
• Optimize the lever action of the foot
## Tripod Awareness
To activate the arches, athletes should first get in touch with the tripod of the foot. The “tripod”
of the foot includes:
• The heel
• The ball of the little toe
• The ball of the big toe
Once an athlete has an awareness of these three points, they should notice how they are being
altered through the course of various exercises. 
- During squatting, for example, an athlete should be asked if they can feel where the pressure in the foot is going during the movement. 
- During single leg stance exercises, such as a single leg RDL, they should note what parts of the tripod might be biased, and other points where pressure is lacking.
In most human movements, starting with awareness of the body is a very good idea, and habit
for athletes to get into. This mentality can feed into all dynamic movement, plyometrics,
sprinting and beyond. 
Athletes are much more used to being told what to do than to check in with their own bodies, but the ownership (and artistry) that comes out of a high level of internal awareness for athletes is a valuable and important tool.
## Proprioceptive and Sensory Foot Training
Awareness of the foot can be built upon, and enhanced, by exposing the foot to proprioceptive
challenges, and external stimulation. Here are some basic sensory tools to help the foot improve
its sensory ability.
• Adarian Barr’s various insoles are helpful, since they “train” the arches to form well on their own
• Standing on textured rocks or natural surfaces
• Place a nickel under and slightly behind the 3rd metatarsal head
Beyond sensation, we also have tools that can build proprioceptive ability, such as PVC pipes and balance discs. I frequently use these in my own and my client training sessions to fantastic results.
There may be a lot of negative buzz about “balance tools” in the realm of strength training, since training on these balance pieces allows the body more options, and therefore less expression of absolute force. 
The thing to remember is that most explosive sporting situations require far more “balance” than we think.
Simply watching a child learn how to walk will help you appreciate just how much balance is
actually required in our day to day movements. There is no doubt that standard land-based
exercises require a good degree of balance, but for training the feet, and getting more reactive
firing out of the intrinsic muscles, I find that selecting hard-point balance training options can be
extremely helpful.
I have found that athletes who struggle with PVC pipe work almost always struggle with managing
their foot-strike in running and sprinting, and are often heel-strikers in nature. Being heavy on
the heels in running, jumping, and other movements tends to go hand-in-hand with being poor
at proprioceptive foot training. I have seen this over and over.
## Training Lever Systems of the Foot
There are several ways to assess the action of the foot as one moves through a single step in a
walk step, run or sprint. You could assess it on the level of early, mid and late stance. You could
talk about heel rockers and forefoot rockers. I like using the terminology that Adarian Barr will
refer to when it comes to the stages of gait, and this is on the level of “lever systems”.
When the foot is in a first class lever, this means that the heel is the fulcrum point. Think of an
athlete doing a squat with the heels down, pushing the knees far forward to visualize this idea.
When the foot is working as a second class lever, this means the ball of the foot is now the fulcrum
point. Think of an athlete landing on the ball of the foot in the second step of acceleration as a
good example of the foot as a second class lever.
Good athleticism is about the ability to get to a second class lever with the appropriate timing
(often times, the faster the better), and then to have great strength in that second class lever
position once an athlete gets there.
### First and Second Class Levers
First Class Lever: Squat 
Second Class Lever: Acceleration
Strength in the first class lever position is built largely by weight room methods, and most
methods that work on vertical force vectors only. A standing or seated calf raise is a first class
lever experience. 
In many ways, a second class lever is an isometric-focused movement, and also uses a lot of horizontal momentum (think early and late stance). In this sense, we can really only train strength and power in the second class lever in a gym setting using elements such as:
• Heel taps with the knee slightly forward
• Very small amplitude hops
• Jumps in a squatted position with heels off the ground
• Isometric movements in bent knee positions
• Movements where we allow the knee to travel far forward while the heel comes up
A problem arises when athletes “blow through” the point where the first class lever based off the heel, should end and the second class should start, and just keep continuing with the first class lever (see right). In other words, athletes who keep the heel down longer than it should be in a jump, acceleration, or sprint are not operating optimally.
The “fixes” to getting a better second class lever strategy can exist on both the micro and macro level. 
- On the micro level, we have the solutions like training the foot arches, and then working quick taps, hops and holds (a high volume of this work is generally needed). 
- On the macro level, we have more biomechanically oriented solutions, such as “long to high” bounds, which we’ll cover in the plyometric module. 
Ultimately, the ability to use the foot more optimally as a second class lever starts on the micro level (this section) and then can later extend to the macro (the plyometric, and locomotion sections).
### Heel Spurs, Vertical Jumping, and Class 2 Levers
Back in the early 2000’s, there was an anecdote of an athlete who was self-admittedly nothing
special from a genetic perspective, who was troubled with heel spurs. The heel spur pain caused
him to walk with a heavy bias on the balls of the feet (which most certainly engaged the
transverse arch of foot heavily, and caused a class 2 lever bias). This individual, at 6 feet in height,
could reportedly get both of his elbows over a basketball rim.
- This anecdote goes to show that a combination of “class 2” action, and lots of repetitions over time, strengthened much more than just this athletes’ calves, but his bones, tendons and fascial system, as well as the neuromuscular patterning related to the balls of the feet.
Although there are potential issues with “playing on the toes” (athletes who don’t use their heels well are injury prone, and have less movement options) it shows us an important lesson when it comes to repetition and the lower leg in explosive movements.
