## Understanding Retention
Seasonality is party of the business, aim for >95% for 80% of the year.
	*Prepare* for the lowest months (for year-round facilities, this is Sept. & April), and outpace through the highest-revenue months (Jan, May, June, Nov.)
## The Critical Number
Critical Gross Revenue, ensure you average out over the year.
	30% Operating Expenses, 40% Payroll, 30% Profit
## 5 Systems to Overcome Seasonality
### 1. Onboarding
The first 100 days are the most important. If you can make it positive in those first-100, athletes will typically stay for 3-5yrs (for a school-age athlete, that’s the duration of high-school)
	Graham uses a welcome box (shirt, bracelet, magnet, stickers, lanyard, water bottle)
- Call after the first day, to the parent of the athlete — how did the first day go?
- Handwritten note on branded stationary, address to athlete’s house, a “Welcome to the Team”
- Automated Onboarding Sequence:
	- Personalized Video → how to track progress → using USR (see [[Universal Speed Rating]]) → using tech → soreness → nutrition → referral process (bring a friend pass) → engagement texts → review ask
### 2. Ongoing Accountability
- Weekly At-Risk 
- Monthly Reach-Outs (celebration about how the athlete is doing) 
- 3-Month Progress Report
- In-Season Support (attending games, showcase on socials, showing up for hardships just as success)
### 3. Culture
- Before **and** after training
- Wristbands for Promotion — based on attendance, similar to a Jiujitsu model of belts and stripes
- Speed Limit Signs / Flight Club (see [[Tony Holler]] and Rank, Record, Publish)
- Events (Staff v Athlete Dodgeball, Movie-Night for Youth-Kids, etc. Think Youth-Group.)
- Athlete of the Month (in the newsletter, on the socials, etc.)
### 4. Marketing
- Monthly Marketing
	- Organic (unpaid):
		- Email || Text
		- Reactivations — who was with last-year, who isn’t sticking, reach out again
		- Referrals — guest-passes, bring-a-friend campaign (bringing friends for free for 2wks at start of every quarter), $100 Bill for athlete-driven referrals
		- Reviews (10 p/month) || FB Groups (5 posts p/month)
		- Workshops || Team Speed Analysis (1 each gym p/month: parents sign a waiver, that’s the contact to follow-up, but the report is given to both athletes and the coach for mutual benefit)
	- Paid — FB Ads
### 5. Service
- Optimize the Model — Do 1 thing really well, minimize distractions. You don’t need the facility full all day long, and you don’t need adult training or 1-on-1 training to be a successful business.
- Schedule Clearly (an app, etc. Graham uses Push-Press)
- Leave flexibility (multiple times to choose from)
- Weekly Meetings with staff
- Consistency across class-times and locations
## Question: Getting Kids into the private facility vs the high-school training with their team?
They market largely off speed and agility.
Work with the school’s strength coach: if you’re a trusted source for parents, and you make the effort to work *with* their existing program, they’ll lean towards you.
