# [[Alex Natera]] — Using ISOs for Speed Development
## Benefits
- Protection from ECC Loading (helps augment ECC-RFD, maybe??)
- Angle-Specific STR Development (+/- 10deg or so from position) + Improvement in traditional expression
- Fascicle length changes (significant advantage to high-velocity movements)
- High Recoverability, even when workload is high
## Example Study for Stiffness
1. Ankle ISO-Push (5deg), 5 x (4x3s @ 90% MVIC) — 4x p/wk for 14wks
2. Ankle ISO, 1 x (10x15s @ 80% MVIC) + Hops and Drop-Jumps at 5x10 — 4x p/wk for 12wks
Combined method was more effective than pure-ISOs, but they were close.

> [!TIP] Performing ISO Reps
> **Standard OVC Programming:** SL as usual, but *alternating legs each rep* (3s R-Leg, 3s off, 3s L-Leg, 3s off).
> Doubling the rest-period we were getting out of last-years programming using this method.
> 
> **”Ballistic” OVC Programming:** Bilateral, lifting one leg on coach-command. Should be short, aiming for quickness of switching
## Training Frequency 
- 3x p/wk: some traditional strength, if managed well; RSIST Pushes /Holds / Switches
- 1x p/wk (or 1x p/10days): heavy ECC’s, heavy STR, RSIST Catches
