# Exercises
## #1: Booms
Stress the movement while other actions occur, always challenging the movement to be as clean as possible. It becomes the go-to position. 
Key Points: tall posture and reaching for the ground, knees passing as high up as possible to simulate positive running.
## #2: Hip Hike / High-Hip Action
Purpose: To teach a better position for the hips. Ideally, when an athlete is on one leg at midstance phase, the hip of the stance leg should hold the leg in place directly underneath the hip socket, and the outside of the foot should line up with the outside of the body. The hip of the swing leg hip should be slightly higher than the hip of the stance leg.
## #3: Ankle-Foot Action
Progression: Works on the stiffness of the ankle. The key is to keep the ankles as stiff as possible.
