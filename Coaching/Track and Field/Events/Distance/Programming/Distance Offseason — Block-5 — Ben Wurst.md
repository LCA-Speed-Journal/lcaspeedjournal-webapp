# Distance Offseason — Block-5 — Ben Wurst

Block-5 is the last full block before the outdoor season. **Mile is the anchor pace** for all goal-pace work; 3k/5k and tempo support the 3k predictor and mile development. Anaerobic capacity progresses from Block-4’s 3×(8×200m) to **2×(8×300m)** at goal-mile. Testing in Week 4 is a **3k predictor**. All three loading weeks (5A, 5B, 5C) use the same Wed/Sat structure as Block-4: **Wed = Workout A (aerobic capacity), Sat = Workout B (anaerobic capacity)**. There is no meet in Block-5. Loading weeks maintain or increase load relative to Block-4; deload is reserved for 5D and early outdoor. Two weeks after the Block-5 deload, outdoor practices begin.

**Ref. Paces (Block-5):** Goal-Mile 4:45–4:55/mi (or current target); 3k 5:05–5:20/mi; 5k 5:25–5:35/mi; 10k 5:45–5:55/mi; Tempo 5:55–6:05/mi; HM 6:05–6:15/mi; Easy > 8:45/mi; AE 6:45–7:15/mi; Long Run 7:25–8:40/mi.

**Block-4 / Block-5 alignment (Wed = Workout A, Sat = Workout B):**

| Week | Wed (Workout A)       | Sat (Workout B)            |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| 5A   | 5–6×1k @ 3k           | 2×(8×300m) @ Goal-Mile     |
| 5B   | 6×1k @ 3k             | 2×(8×300m) @ Goal-Mile     |
| 5C   | 6×1k @ 3k             | 2×(8×300m) @ Goal-Mile     |
