# Distance Offseason — Ben Wurst

## Block themes (summary)

This offseason is built around **[[Joe Rubio]]’s annual progression**: primary pace moves from **5k** (summer/fall) → **3k** (winter) → **1500m/mile** (spring), with “distance runner first”—developing aerobic and anaerobic *conditioning* plus aerobic *capacity* before loading anaerobic capacity (speed work)—and avoiding raising mileage and intensity in the same step. The blocks below follow that progression in condensed form; one main workout per week carries the primary stimulus, others maintain adjacent paces.

- **[[Distance Offseason — Block-1 — Ben Wurst|Block 1]]:** Ease out of soccer; rebuild with 5k rhythm, tempo, and capacity; STR/Mobility A/B; optional Tue and light structure. 
	- **Test:** 5k time trial (e.g. 17:40 ±10s). 
	- *Rubio:* 5k as effective primary (tempo below, 5k rhythm, aerobic capacity); rebuild volume before intensity—“don’t raise mileage and intensity together.”
- **[[Distance Offseason — Block-2 — Ben Wurst|Block 2]]:** Settle into a routine (weights Tue/Thu, two main sessions + long run); 3k rhythm and capacity; fartlek and progressions. 
	- **Test:** 5×1k @ 3k. 
	- *Rubio:* Shift to **3k primary** (secondaries 5k & 1500m); aerobic capacity and anaerobic conditioning at 3k/5k/tempo; “distance runner first” still dominant.
- **[[Distance Offseason — Block-3 — Ben Wurst|Block 3]]:** 5k/10k and 3k emphasis; first mile-paced work (e.g. 4×(10×100m) Goal-Mile, 3×300m @ 1500m); first indoor meet in week 2 (1600m). 
	- **Test:** 5k TT (e.g. 17:25 ±10s). 
	- *Rubio:* Winter phase with **3k primary**; first dedicated anaerobic-capacity (mile) dose—only after aerobic/anaerobic conditioning and aerobic capacity are in place, per Rubio’s sequence for meaningful speed gains.
- **[[Distance Offseason — Block-4 — Ben Wurst|Block 4]]:** Shift toward “3k into mile”; Wed = Workout A (e.g. 1k or 5k/800s), Sat = Workout B anaerobic (4×(10×100m) then 3×(8×200m) @ Goal-Mile); Week 1 is meet week. 
	- **Test:** Kosmin (4×60s @ Goal-Mile). 
	- *Rubio:* Pre-competition turn toward **1500m/mile primary** (secondaries 3k & 800m); Wed maintains aerobic capacity, Sat is the primary anaerobic-capacity day.
- **[[Distance Offseason — Block-5 — Ben Wurst|Block 5]]:** Mile as main pace; 2×(8×300m) @ Goal-Mile; 3k predictor in deload; no meet; last full block before outdoor. 
	- **Test:** 1600m TT.
	- *Rubio:* **Spring / 1500m primary**; mile anchors all goal-pace work, 3k/5k and tempo support; 2×(8×300m) extends anaerobic-capacity at race pace; 3k predictor checks fitness before the competition phase.
