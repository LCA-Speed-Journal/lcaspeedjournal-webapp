# Prime-Times
- Pre-Games
- Posterior-Pattern Fixes
- Need to Push Ground **behind**, don’t cut things too short on the striding
	- Look for Undulation, means overly quad-dominant
# Isometrics
- Isometrics as Occlusion Training (~40s or less, 50% Load)
	- Follow with 60s light-load, same muscle, continuous movement
- “Belt” SQ OVC ISO
	- Almost Preferred to Supramaximal-ISO
- Reverse-Hyper ISO: for fixing 0-5m
# Misc Thoughts
- Straight-Leg Lateral Skip
- Yuris in Doorways?
- Add Stress on **Good Patterns**
	- Don’t put added stress on already poor patterns, fix the pattern first
