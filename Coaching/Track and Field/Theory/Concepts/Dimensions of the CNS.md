*Coined largely by DB Hammer, but popularized by Fichter and Korfist, the Dimensions of the CNS is a way to help categorize the primary functions of athletic performance based on how the **nervous system** responds.

## Rate (Speed)
Rate is the speed of signaling from brain to muscle.
### Training RATE
- Drop-Catches
- Drop-Rebound Catches
- Reflexive Concentrics
- Oscillations
---
## Magnitude (Intensity)
Magnitude is how “intense” the signal to muscle is. 
	As we know this is just switches on/off, it is moreover a representation of signal-density–to turn on more motor-units in less time.
### Training MAG
There are numerous ways to train MAG:
- [[Acceleration]]-Focused Work
	- Short Accels
	- Resisted Accels
- Jumps
	- For Distance
	- For Height
- Bounds
(see also: [[Hebb’s Law]], [[Henneman’s Size Principle]])

---
## Duration (Capacity)
Duration, sometimes referred to as Capacity, is how long we can continue signaling a muscle.
### Training DUR
- Oscillations / AMRAPs for >7s
- Incomplete Rest-Intervals (see also: [[Lactic Training]])
- Clusters
