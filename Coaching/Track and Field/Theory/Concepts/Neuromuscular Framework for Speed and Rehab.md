# Neuromuscular Framework for Speed and Rehab
[[Ryan Grubbs]] — Houston Texans

- Good Rehab is Good Training (regardless of if we call it “Rehab” or “Performance”)
- Lifting Weights, Periodization is more than just Manipulating Load & Avg. Velocity
## Four-Phase Return-to-Field Protocol (Hamstring Example)
### Return to Field
- Making sure Pain is Submaximal
- Nord-Board Screening is 50-70%
- Upper-Body Lifting, Re-Introducing Lower-Body on uninjured leg
### Load-Introduction
- Nord-Board (Prone ISO), Force-Deck screening is within 30% between legs
- Beginning 50% Volume of Accel/Decel, and High-Speed Distances
- Tempo-Work, Low-Intensity COD
### 3. Reconditioning
- Screenings are within 20% between legs (adding a Nordic screening as well)
- 75-100% Total Volume, bringing High-Speed up to 75%
- “Speed and Power-First Mindset” — Chasing Intensity and Qualities
	- Build the Engine before Filling the Gas-Tank
### 4. Football Performance
- Screenings are within 15% between legs
- Matching Game-Demands with Volume
## 4 Layers of Rehab Framework
1. Wire the CNS, Remodel Tissue to apply Large Forces thru the Limbs (Gym-Work)
2. Tie Up any Energy-Leaks causing Friction (Tissue-Specific)
3. Intentional about *how* tissues are loading (Movement-Analysis, Kinematics)
4. Prepping the Athlete to be Robust (thrive under the demands of sport)
## Periodizing Variables over Blocks
### Loaded Gym-Based
- Time to Peak-Velocity (Rate)
	- [[Randy Huntington]] Reference — Onset of CON-Phase to the Moment of Peak CON-Velo
	- Looking to Increase Time-to-PeakV by Enhancing ECC-RFD (again, [[Eccentric Forces and Athlete Profiling|ECC-Forces Lecture]])
	- “Performance-Zone” — 200-400ms Window around Late-ECC to Early-CON Phases
- Load (Force)
### Plyo Patterns
- GCT (Rate)
- Ground Reaction Forces (Force)
### General Ideas
- Time to Peak Velocity: Slow to Fast
- GCT: Long to Short
- CON & ECC Peak-Power: Low to High
- Ground Reaction Forces: Low-to-High
- ECC Velocity: Slow to Fast
## Getting a Faster Time to Peak-Velo
### Full-ROM
Advantages:
- Greater Mean and Peak ECC/CON Velocity
- Greater Time-Under-Tension
- Greater Glute-Max
**Advice: Lower %1RM, Replace with Band/Air-Resist for more ECC/CON Velocity**
### Partial-ROM
Advantages
- Faster Time to Peak-Velo
- Faster ECC/CON Accelerations
**Advice: Increase-Load and Shorten ROM for more ECC/CON Acceleration**
## Eccentric RFD
Critical for high-quality CON-Accelerations
Goal = Move High-Load + Rapid ECC-Velo + Short Time to Peak-Velo
## Block 0 Programming (Early Offseason, etc.)
*Goal: train the soft-tissue (muscle & tendon) to be able to pull force appropriately. Want to set constraints and limit degrees-of-freedom surrounding joints by controlling velocity and ROM*
### Main Components:
- ISOs (10-30s Yielding ISOs)
- EQI’s (30-45s ECC Lowering)
- Slow and Heavy ECC (5-8s lowering)
## Phase Layout
- 2 Day-Types: Power and Max-STR
	- Phase 1: Loading Intro — Slow and Submax for Both
	- Phase 2: Reconditioning — Power is Fast & Powerful, Max-STR stays same
	- Phase 3: Late-Reconditioning — Max-STR is Heavy & Slow, Power stays same
	- Phase 4: Performance — Power is Explosive & Fast, Max-STR is Fast & Powerful
## Tissue-Specific Gym-Work (Energy-Leaks)
### Hamstring
__Long and Strong isn’t good enough, need to regain hip extension and hip extension *power* as well__
- ISOs — Long-Lever Bridge (Yielding to Overcoming)
- Slow-STR — 1080 Isokinetic ([[Chris Korfist]] drill)
- Power — 1080 Fast CON and ECC
- Dynamic — Bent-Knee to SL Catch & A-Switch
	- (Similar to the [[Alex Natera]] RSIST Switches)
- Plyo — Heavy to Light Scissor-Bounds
- Movement — Sprinting Kinematics
	- Ryan uses [[VueMotion]] → [[Jonas Dodoo]]

### Ankle
__Accel-Position ISOs, Slantboard ISOs, and Calf-Conditioning Circuits for extensive volume and higher frequency__
- ISO — Bent-Knee and Alternating-Leg Yielding / Overcoming ISOS
	- (all the [[RSIST]] stuff)
- Slow-STR — Overloaded Bent-Knee and Single-Leg Calf (2 to 1 Overload)
- Power — Keiser Calf (Explosive)
- Dynamic — Box-Switch Variants, Keiser Switches
	- More Korfist-stuff, like the switches to a lateral box
- Plyo — Pogos (Assisted, Regular, Banded)
- Movement — Heavy Resisted Accels and MaxV Reps
### Knee
__Learning to accept and absorb forces (extensive, deep ROM, High and Low ROM OSC, etc.)__
- ISO — Yielding and Overcoming ISOs (Tall and Bent-Knee)
	- More Natera RSIST-Work
- Slow-STR — Heavy-Medium kBox Variants
- Power — Seated Box-Jump Variants
- Dynamic — ECC-Overloaded Jump Variants (Bands, DBs, etc.)
- Plyo — Altitude Lands, Drop-Jump Variations, Heavy to Light Speed-Bounds
- Movement — Overspeed Decel and COD-Kinematics
	- More VueMotion work for the COD-Kinematics, looking at a 5-10-5, 5-0-5, etc.
## Q&A
### Pop-100 Velocity
Look more into [[Randy Huntington]] and (Ralph Allman?) for more information on this. Feels like it connects to [[Cal Dietz]] and how he talks about the transition from ECC to CON, and sharpening the ISO portion of the movement through the [[Triphasic Training]].
