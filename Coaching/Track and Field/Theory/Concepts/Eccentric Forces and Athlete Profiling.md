(A lot of content referenced in [[(CSAC-1) Profiling#The Role of Eccentric Forces| CSAC-1: ECC Force]])
Braking — Capacity to Yield and Amortize (see [[Tanner Care]])

# Measuring Eccentric RFD / BM (N/S/kg)
Soccer-Population: 20% Higher in Premier-League vs Championship
	Jump Height was only a 2.6% Difference
	Once you got down to standard leagues (i.e. standard vs sub-elite), metrics mattered, but the separating factor between elite and sub-elite was more directly connected to ECC-RFD.
# Applying this Knowledge to Sprinting
## Early-Accel
Primarily propulsive (CON-Dominant). Less impact of a braking phase than other stages
## Late-Accel, MaxV
More braking-intensitve (essentially the first half of the total contact)
