# The Power of Microdosing
[[Stephanie Mock]] —  Athletic Director of Sports Performance at Pitt
- Was also on the [[Coach Em Up]] Pod with [[Tim Riley]]
## The What and the Why
How to train efficiently in-season, working around the various constraints (scheduling for travel, practice, comps, meetings, class demands, etc.) to keep more frequent, consistent exposures.
### Why?
Availability and Training Time are at a Premium. Not uncommon to only get 1-2 training days a week for S&C (hey, that’s us!)
Instead of a low-level courtt warmup for 10-15min, why not warmup in the weightromo for 20-30mins prior to practice?
	More specific stimulus, can elevate the level of play more than a low-level warmup
## Adapting from a Traditional Model

| Variable          | Traditional In-Season | Microdosing         |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Sessions p/wk     | 2-3x p/wk             | 8-10x p/wk          |
| Lifts p/session   | 6-8x p/session        | 1-3x p/session      |
| Minutes p/session | 35-45mins p/session   | 15-20mins p/session |
| Total Work Done   | (same)                | (same)              |
## The Microdosing Playbook: Variables to Consider
- Manipulate ROM
- Bilateral vs Unilateral
- Contact-Length
- Time-Under Tension
- Density (total trainining time, etc.)
- Contraction Type (CON-Only, ECC, ISOs, etc.)
### Timeline
Work with the end in mind (work backwards)
- Summer Prep — Triphasic Focus
- Preseason to Conference Play — touch-up on Triphasic aspects, keep exposures and retain qualities as long as possible
- Conference Play — aligning the stressors in the weight room with the stressors on the court
### Exsample Week: Conference Play (Competition Phase)
- Mon — Regeneration and Recovery
- Tue — Strength
	- High-Force (see [[Hunter Eisenhower]] and his Force System, also referenced in [[(CSAC-5) Programming Speed & Agility#Sample Days (borrowed, Hunter Eisenhower ’s Force-System )|CSAC-5: Programming]])
	- Clean-Variation and Squats
	- Nordics
- Wed — Power and Accessories
	- Trap-Bar (CON-Focused Work)
- Thurs — Speed
	- Loaded Jumps
	- MB Slams and Throws
- Fri — Game
- Sat — Primer / CNS-Work
	- Speed Cleans
	- Box Jumps
	- Accelerated Jumps
- Sun — Game
## Testing and Assessment
Tools used by Pitt
- AMS — Smartabase upload
- Processing — pitt-sportsscience (Github page)
- Sharing — Shiny
### Holistic Development (evaluate team, player, coach)
- Visuomotor Decision-Making
	- NFQ, MOT
	- Vision
- Strength
	- Ab/Adduction, Nordic
- Power
	- CMJ (using Hawkin Dynamics Force-Decks), MaxV
		- ECC-Decel RFD (once again, [[Eccentric Forces and Athlete Profiling]] coming around)
		- CON-Impulse
- Body-Comp
	- FFM, %BF
- Psychosocial Profile
	- Factor-Five Model (OCEAN — Openness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, etc.)
	- Resilience (curious how they evaluate this one on a day-to-day)

> [!INFO] Trainable Qualities: Referencing [[Daniel Bove]]’s *Takeoff*
> ### Eccentric (see “Training the Brakes” Chapter)
> - Altitude Lands
> - Loaded Snap-Downs
> ### Concentric (see “Training Propulsion” Chapter)
> - Seated Box-Jump
> - DB Squat Jump (not a CMJ, going from a pause at the bottom)
> - Oly-Lifting
### Weekly Schedule for Testing and Monitoring
- CMJ: Monday or Tuesday, measuring on the furthest point from gameday
- Wellness: Daily
- VBT Monitoring: Same Day of CMJ, squat and monitor the readiness
## Q&A
### Teams with Multiple Comps in a Week (BBall, Track, etc.)
Have conversations with the sport coaches, manage training intent day-to-day, etc.
	All comes down to communication
