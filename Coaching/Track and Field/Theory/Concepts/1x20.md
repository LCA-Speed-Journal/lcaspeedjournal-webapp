# Overview
*Created by Yessis, applied by Tuura. Need to go through Yessis to actually read the original, but Tuura’s application is perfectly acceptable for our context, so ripping that and plugging it in has worked well thus far.*
Performed 3x p/wk, 1-2wks p/phase, the program is incredibly simple. 
- One total-body workout, repeated across the entire phase
	- Ascending RPE across the week: 6-7 → 7-8 → 8-9
- 1 set of the prescribed amount of reps (10, 15, or 20, depending on phase)
- Perfect Form: if any break in this, stop the set and write it down.
- 30-45s rest between all exercises.
- Phases 2 and 3: Finish the dynamic drills, then perform a set of ISO-Holds to end the workout.

# Phase 1: 1x20
The base-phase, designed to cover the whole body through mostly isolation-driven movements. A single set of each, focusing on perfect work.

# Phase 2: 1x15
Progressing some of the more isolation-driven lifts, combining them into more compounds. Less reps means heavier load, means things are continuing their linear progression all on their own.
Adding ISO-Holds at the end of the sessions, all bodyweight.

# Phase 3: 1x10
At this point, it’s all just the “basic lifting” compounds. ISOs are as long as they’ll be, so we end up getting a quick total-body lift in and just maintaining health. 
	This is usually our end-state of a transition/maintenance, when we’re not trying to build anything more.
