### Big Pieces
- 3x Sprint+Lower, 2x Upper
	- Sprint Days: Rate-Mag-Capacity (see [[Dimensions of the CNS]] and [[DB Hammer]])
- Timed AMRAPs
	- Usually in the 5-7s Range, not much above 10s (see [[Cal Dietz]], fits the Power-Phase of [[Triphasic Training]])
- Superblock-Style Sprint Training
	- Inspired by [[Chris Korfist]], [[Dan Fichter]] (see [[Foundations of Speed]])
- Band Resistance/Assistance
	- Also similar to the [[Triphasic Training]] elements of this program
- **Drawback:** Minimal Vertical-Jump Training, more for speed
### Review:
Liked the overall structure of this program. Have run 2x fully, 1x partially, have gotten decent yield both times.
