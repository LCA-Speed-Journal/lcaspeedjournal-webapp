# **Big Ideas**
## [[+Sprints Programming|Sprints/Jumps]]
#### ***Big Idea: the [[Foot & Lower-Leg]] are the Foundation***
#### *Concept: The Dose Makes the Poison*
*See [[Tony Holler]] and [[Feed the Cats]] for more on a low-volume method. Not a perfect agreement, but a good idea.*
- Lean towards a **Low-Volume Model**, but not opposed to a little more capacity work (as [[Chris Korfist]])
#### *Concept:* 
## [[Distance Programming|Distance]]
#### *Concept: Find Key Distances, then Target +1/-1
*See [[Joe Rubio]] and [[Steve Magness]] for two similar, but different approaches on this.*

## Weight-Room Ideology

# **Sources: Inspiring Ideas / Programs**
## [[Hypertrophy Clusters]]
#### *Concept: Less Reps, More Sets*
*Ex. (Goal: 40 Total Reps) — **4x10 → 8x5, 10x4.*** 
- Allows for moving of higher relative loads per set, while keeping quality / power-outputs higher
- Also leaves more bandwidth for things like supersets/circuit-work, as the main-work set doesn’t leave individuals as gassed
#### *Concept: More [[Antagonistic Supersets]]*
*More of an upper-body concept, since it’s less systemically fatiguing, but can pair lower with something like a prehab-style movement.*
## [[Racehorse 2]]
#### *Concept: [[Extensive-Rapid-Strides]]*
*A good progressive warmup-structure, gets gradually more intense while also getting a good amount of low-to-mid level plyos involved.*
- See Also: [[Bounce Fire Series]] and [[Brian Kula]]
#### *Concept: Superblock-Style Speed Work*

#### *Concept: Working Accessory Patterns into the Main Lift*
*Ex. Placing Spring-Ankle alongside the main squat-pattern of the day, as a superset/circuit, rather than putting it as its own work at the end of the workout*
- Rationale: less likely to skip, more likely to give higher-effort, 
- Allows for higher accessory-volume with lower perception of fatigue
## [1x20]
#### *Concept: Lower Total-Volume for Higher-Frequency*
*Only 1 set is a lot less taxing, allows us to spread out the work but still get a good amount of maintenance.*
- OG Program: 3x p/wk, total body. 
- From Experience: doesn’t feel like a lot to recover from, very manageable.
#### *Concept: Full-Body, All The Time*
