# Theory

Coaching theory, concepts, courses, and philosophy

## Concepts

Core training and performance concepts

- [[1x20]]: [[Dr. Michael Yessis]] 1x20 method applied by [[Jake Tuura]], performed 3x p/wk with one total-body workout repeated across phase, 1 set of prescribed reps (10/15/20), perfect form requirement, 30-45s rest, with phase-specific exercise tables and ISO-hold additions in phases 2-3.
- [[Cal Q&A 1-3-25]]: [[Cal Dietz]] Q&A session notes covering prime-times (pre-games, posterior-pattern fixes, need to push ground behind), isometrics (as occlusion training, belt SQ OVC ISO, reverse-hyper ISO), and miscellaneous thoughts (straight-leg lateral skip, add stress on good patterns).
- [[Characteristics of Speed]]: [[Alan Murdoch]] x Speedworks graphic defining speed as large forces, short time frames, right direction - it's a game of impulse.
- [[Cheat Code]]: [[Tim Riley]] Cheat Code program covering split (6x p/wk: 2x upper, 2x lower, 2x field-days), block 1 structure (accel-day with contrast sprints, squat-day with contrast supersets, upper-push, maxV, hinge, upper-pull), and detailed workout structures with progressions.
- [[Dimensions of the CNS]]: DB Hammer concept (popularized by [[Dan Fichter]] and [[Chris Korfist]]) categorizing primary functions based on nervous system responses covering Rate (speed of signaling, training methods), Magnitude (intensity/signal-density, training methods), Duration (capacity, how long we can continue signaling, training methods), and examples/applications.
- [[Eccentric Forces and Athlete Profiling]]: [[Les Spellman]] eccentric forces and athlete profiling covering measuring eccentric RFD (20% higher in Premier League vs Championship, jump height only 2.6% difference), applying to sprinting (early-accel primarily propulsive, late-accel/maxV more braking-intensive), and connection to braking capacity.
- [[Force-System]]: [[Hunter Eisenhower]] force system framework covering slow force day (A-day: high-tissue, low neural with hip ISO, yielding press, heavy push/pull, med-ball, core+regen), high force day (B-day: impulse, braking power with box depth-jumps, drop-catches, OVC ISOs, heavy Olys, med-ball rotational throws, reactive jumps), and fast force day (C-day: high neural, elastic with ankle ISO, oscillations, drop-jumps, MB vertical throws, band-assisted jumps).
- [[Functional Neurology]]: Functional neurology concepts with references to Square1 System, RPR, Infinity Walks, [[Matt Boule]]/Posturology, and Revolutions in Speed 2 functional neurology concepts.
- [[Hypertrophy Clusters]]: [[Jake Tuura]] hypertrophy clusters program covering overview (4 days p/wk, 3 phases: 8x5 → 10x4 → 12x3, clusters on primary lifts), phase 1 structure (upper bench/row and push-press/pull-up supersets, lower front-squat, total DL+upper-capacity), and phase 2 progression with detailed exercise breakdowns.
- [[Just Fly (Tim Riley, Will Ratelle)]]: Just Fly podcast episode with [[Joel Smith]] hosting [[Tim Riley]] and [[Will Ratelle]] covering strength and conditioning and coaching philosophy topics.
- [[Muscle Tonus]]: Muscle tonus concepts from Revolutions in Speed 2 covering key takeaways (too much: faster stretch or drop-based exercises, too little: OVC ISOs or short-concentrics), helpful tip (intra-set RPR with double inverted U method quoted by [[Cal Dietz]]).
- [[Neuromuscular Framework for Speed and Rehab]]: [[Ryan Grubbs]] (Houston Texans) neuromuscular framework covering good rehab is good training, lifting weights and periodization, four-phase return-to-field protocol for hamstring example, four layers of rehab framework (wire CNS, tie up energy leaks, intentional tissue loading, prepping for robustness), periodizing variables over blocks (loaded gym-based, plyo patterns, general ideas), and getting faster time to peak-velocity (full-ROM advantages, eccentric velocity, band/air-resist considerations).
- [[Racehorse 2]]: [[Lachen Reid]] Racehorse 2 program covering big pieces (3x sprint+lower, 2x upper, sprint days: Rate-Mag-Capacity, timed AMRAPs 5-7s range, superblock-style sprint training, band resistance/assistance), drawback (minimal vertical jump training, more for speed), and program structure review.
- [[RPR]]: Reflexive Performance Reset system co-founded by [[Cal Dietz]] and [[Chris Korfist]] for improving athletic performance and reducing pain by addressing neurological imbalances.
- [[Separating Groups by Deficiency]]: [[Les Spellman]] CSAC approach to separating training groups covering breaking into groups relative to high/low force deficient and high/low velocity deficient, group 0 (special: very poor accel <50% RF), group 1 (strength-speed: >50% RF, Tau 1.1+), group 2 (power: >50% RF, Tau 1-1.1), and additional groups with specific training prescriptions for 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day examples.
- [[Speed Standard by Age]]: Speed standards by age group covering 14-16 (developmental 1), 16-18 (developmental 2), 18-21 (collegiate), and 21+ (pro) with male and female benchmarks for various speed metrics.
- [[The Power of Microdosing]]: [[Stephanie Mock]] (Pitt) microdosing approach covering what and why (training efficiently in-season around constraints, availability and training time at premium), adapting from traditional model (sessions p/wk, lifts p/session, minutes p/session comparison table), microdosing playbook variables (ROM, bilateral vs unilateral, contact-length, TUT, density, contraction type), timeline (summer prep, preseason to conference, conference play), example week for conference play, and testing and assessment tools.
