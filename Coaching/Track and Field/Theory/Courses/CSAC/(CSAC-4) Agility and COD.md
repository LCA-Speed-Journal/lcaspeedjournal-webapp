## Components
Rapid, whole-body change of direction and speed in response to a stimulus.
- COD: Decel + Direction Change
	- Decel is the piece people forget about. Every COD involves decel, at varying magnitudes
- Response to Stimulus: Perception, then reaction based on (Individual, Task, and Environment)
## Eight-Vector
(book recommendation from Les)
**Goal:** raise the level of skilled performance using the interaction between **individual, task, and environment.**
	The way an athlete changes direction when they can preplan is *different* from how they change direction when reacting to a stimulus.
## How to Measure?
GPS-Data, or (ADA or COD) Test
- ADA: 20yd Accel into a Stop
- COD: 5-0-5 with 180° turn (or 10-0-5, 5-10-5, etc.)
## Angle of COD
**GO** — Uphill (0-45)
**SLOW DOWN** — Transition (45-60)
**HIT THE BRAKES** — Downhill (60-180)
# Drills
## Drops (Everyday)
Teaching body-positioning, rapid drop of the hip while controlling trunk.
## Horizontal Brakes (Every Other Day)
Teaching foot-position on the brake step, using assistance to increase intensity and hip/torso drop.
Horiz. Speed Brakes: 
	progress the entry-speed, take as many steps as needed, progressively decreasing the decel-zone
## Vector Progression (1-2x p/wk)
Cuts (half-turn): all downhills require half-turn. Trigger → Plant → Final-Foot
	Aiming for that three-step decel, though may need to be longer when developing athlete
Cuts (45-90 cut): one step or multi-step.
	Working on changing direction while preserving momentum, whether that’s re-angling or fully pivoting
## Curve-Runs (Les Includes 1x p/wk)
S-Curve Race 
	(5yd offset, 10yd per segment, but start with a 2-3yd offset) — (see also: [[Lachen Reid]] and Weave-Sprints)
Figure-8 Race
	(see also: [[Infinity Walks]])
Arc-Race
	(Example used was 3m depth, 10m across)
## Lateral Games
Vector Cutting: 
	Offense plays a 5s mirror game, then picks to cut L/R, and defender needs to chase and pursue
# Creating Variation in Drills
- Change the vector, change the pattern (linear run, shuffle, x-over run, backpedal)
- Decel-Challenges (5m:2.5m, 10m:4m, 15m:5m)
- Complexity: preplanned, auditory, reactive
- Level: pre-planned, speed, chaos (decision-making component)
