Two biggest outcomes of drills in accel: **Projection** and **Orientation**
	Cannot run fast unless we can project forward, “throwing ourselves forward in space.”
### 3 Buckets: Transfer (Context) || Horizontal (Resisted) || Vertical (A-Series/Flexion)
Most mileage out of transfer, then horizontal, but A-series is good rudiments.
## Vertical Series
A-Walk — March — Switch — Triple-A
- Walk is about ROM, March is about attacking the ground, Switch is about fast-switch, and Triple-A is more about rhythm/timing
## Horizontal Series
 Banded March — Banded Bound — March-Bound — 1-3 Step Repeats
- Marches about attack-angle (short push, attack ground), Bound about power (long-push), March-Bound is about patterning (extending the push), Repeats are about Rhythm
#### Les’s distances for an accel-ladder (ft-in)
0 || 3-3 || 6-7 || 11-0 || 15-6 || 20-8 || 26-0 || 31-5
