# How do we measure?
Splits, GPS/1080, and video.
Split-Times: usually favor a fly-10 as a standard unit-of-measure, but is measuring avg speed in a zone, not peak/instantaneous
GPS: any run, medium reliability, but will measure peak speed.
Video: fly-10 favorable, can actually get instantaneous speed.
# Technical Differences
### Touchdown Differences
More FWD in accel, longer contact-times.
MaxV has minimal braking with quicker contacts and a more vertical foot.
### Midstance
More horizontal, with longer stance and more oblique shin angles in accel
MaxV has minimal vertical force, focused on efficient transmission through the ground
### Toe-Off
Accel is more about projection and an active push, the ground behind COM
MaxV is about speed maintenance, more passive recoil and elasticity (incomplete extension)
# Standards by Age: World Class → V. Poor
**World-Class || Excellent || V. Good || Good || Fair || Poor || V Poor**
Standards are for **team-sport.** Not track-level here, their speeds tend to push higher.
![[Speed Standard by Age]]
# *What makes people run fast?*
1. **Generate** massive forces: initially thru muscles (co-contractions).
2. **Resist** those forces — Once we hit ground, job of the body is to resist compression and load the tendons/spring.
3. **Recycle** Elastic Energy — need to recycle the energy we’re loading into the springs
4. **Repeat** the Cycle, Rapidly
5. Maintain Postural **Efficiency** — need to keep things in alignment, otherwise we get energy leaks.
### Creating Maximum Forces, in Minimal Times
(cite. [[Peter Weyand]], [[Ken Clark]])
The difference between elites and sub-elites is the spike in GRF — spiking this earlier means a steeper in initial peak, shortens our GCT too.
	Gotta be careful here: spiking this super high without being able to absorb means it just mushes.
### Angles
Thigh-Angular Velocity (as [[Ken Clark]])
	increase this angular velocity increases foot velocity before ground-contact, letting us spike larger and earlier
Thigh Block-height (from ground)
	Want to attack the ground from the highest point possible, gives leg more time to attack.
	Bigger windup, more room to accel into the ground
## Challenges in the Running Cycle
### Form-Cues
- **Punch**: Late Flexion
	- Create big frontside range (72-80°)
- **Attack**: Early Extension
	- Attack from above, accel foot into ground
- **Rip**: Early-Flexion 
	- Rip foot from the ground quickly (beware, ROM and strength of hip dictates this)
- **Push**: Late-Extension
	- Push the ground away fast (limited by strength overall)
### Foot/Ankle at Touchdown
Want a stiff foot/ankle — if this isn’t stiff, leads to poor preparedness to strike, drags out our GCT longer than it needs to be
### Thigh-Angle
(similar to [[Tony Holler]]’s “Big-Split” concept)
We want a big range to give us room to accelerate foot into the ground. However, big range doesn’t mean anywhere — frontside should be about 70% of this, we don’t want to be too backside
	Optimal Angle: 105° (see Clark 105’s by [[Cal Dietz]]) — 25-30 backside, 72-25 frontside
## The Importance of Posture
Posture plays a huge role in the resting tension of muscles
	(Example: tipped pelvis shortens muscles, leads to less SSC and less ROM. Anterior Tilt → more backside-dominant, ends up with sole of shoe to sky
### Key Positions
(kinogram reminiscent of [[Jonas Dodoo]] / [[Speedworks]] — VueMotion kinograms and the [[PSR Model]])
# Drills
## A-Series
- Overhead PVC-Walk, Marches, Skips, Switches
### Straight-Leg Series (Prime-Times)
- Small, Small-to-Big, Big-Scissors, Scissor-to-Bleed
### Dribbles
- Ankle, Calf, Knee, Dribble-Bleed
### Wickets
- Small-Cones, build up from there
