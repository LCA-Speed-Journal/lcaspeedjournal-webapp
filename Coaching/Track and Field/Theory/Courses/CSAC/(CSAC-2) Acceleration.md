# Background Information
Acceleration: the rate at which an athlete increases speed.
	Vector Quality: Direction and Magnitude
Most game-defining actions occur at submax speeds, but with high neuromusc. demand (pressing, recovering, attacking, etc.). 
	But they all have intentional acceleration.
## How to Measure
Big Three: FVP, Timing-Gates, GPS-Derived Metrics
Hard vs Easy Accels (<2m/s^2, vs 3-4 m/s^2)
	Peak Accels can be upwards of 9m/s^2 
### Split Times and Analysis
0-10: Early Accel — sensitive to starting parameters
5-10: Early-to-Late Accel — doesn’t capture the 5yd split
10-20: Late-Accel / Speed — heavily influenced by max-velocity ceiling
## Force-Velocity Profiling (cite: [[JB Morin]])
f0: peak horizontal force
v0: peak horizontal velocity
RF: Ratio of horizontal force at start
dRF: Decrease in Horizontal Force as velocity increases
pMax: max-power, in W/kg
## Comparative Analysis
Z-Scoring for Decisions: compare within group. 
	Don’t compare between groups — will have different demands, and likely their numbers will reflect that.
Another 2-Axis: Velocity vs Force
- Upper Row: Strength-Dominant → Explosive
- Lower Row: Developmental → Velocity-Dominant
## Understanding Accel Metrics
Spatiotemporal Vars: GCT, Airtime, Step-Length, Step-Frequency
Orientation Values; Trunk & Shin-Angles
How Values Progress: how do the metrics change across the acceleration phase
Braking vs Propulsion: when foot lands in front of body, it’s braking, but time after it’s under hip, it’s propulsive
	(see [[Chris Korfist]])
## The Importance of Airtime
**Step Length** = distance from point of contact of one foot, to point of contact for *next*
**Stride Length** = distance from ground-contact of one foot, to point of contact for *same*
**Stride Frequency**: one stride = 2 steps, with each step = GCT + AT
	Stride time = 2 x (GCT+AT) — Frequency = 1 / Stride-Time
### As GCT decreases, AT increases, and StepL Increases — **Step Velocity increases**
# Manipulating Ground and Airtime for Speed
## Drive Phase Mechanics
- Make sure smooth transition of shin and torso — piston legs and low heel-recovery
- Shin at foot-strike is perpendicular — increases 2-3° per stride
## Hip Projection and Touchdown
**Projection**: horizontal dist. the hips travel during ground-contact, from touchdown (horizontal)
**Touchdown**: horitontal dist from center of mass (hips) to the point of ground-contact
	Negative-Step: Forward projection, backward touchdown
**Takeoff Distance** (similar, but diff): Horizontal distance from athlete’s center of mass (hips) to toe-off
## Progression over Strides 0-3
- Hip-projection increases with each step
- Takeoff-distance decreases (triple-extension is a myth, remember. Extension is decreasing.)
	- Massive extension likely means spending too much time on the ground
- Touchdown starts negative or low, increases over time
# Projection vs Takeoff Distances
## Early-Accel: 
GCT > Air-time. 
Usually steps 1-4, primarily focused on overcoming inertia. 
	FWD-leaning shin, push oriented. “Driving through the ground.”
## Late-Accel: 
Air-Time > GCT. 
Usually steps 5-10, transitioning to velocity, more switch-oriented. 
	More upright-shin, focusing on vertical force and “floating between steps.”
## Understanding Running Phases
Touchdown: Point-of-Contact
Full-Support: full bodyweight is over the foot
Takeoff: toe-off period.
# Switching (between peak flex / extens):
slow sprinters switch later, faster sprinters switch earlier (~10% diff, 75 vs 85% of stance). 
Early switching is more efficient ground-contact termination. 
Faster / More Forceful switch allows athlete a greater ability to reposition the leg.
	(see [[Ryan Grubbs]] for more info on Switching — have lecture on him from [[+Athletes Acceleration Content]] webinar)
## Calf-Stiffness:
Poor? 
	Excessive collapse, delayed push-off, long GCT.
Good? 
	No collapse, good push, shorter GCT.
