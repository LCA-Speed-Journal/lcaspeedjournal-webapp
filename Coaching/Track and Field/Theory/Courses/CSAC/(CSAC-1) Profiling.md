# Background-Info
## Game Profiling: Athlete’s Environment
Understand the needs of the game (related: [[Needs Analysis]])
- How much space do you have to play?
- What are the objectives of play?
- How many players are involved?
Needs of the Game, + Needs of the Athlete (position-specific) defines the needs of training.
## Role of Speed in Game Context
Having higher speed, relative to the opponents in sport, allow
- More opportunities to score,
- Greater ability to maneuver relative to the field
Perceiving world through senses, then reacting to the stimulus applied
# General Philosophy
## Tactical Perspectives on Speed
- Creating Separation: getting away from a defender
	- Moving laterally, jab steps
	- Creating linear separation (out-running opponents)
- Closing Space: more of a defensive move
- Attacking a Gap, Attacking Space
	- Soccer: Making a run, seeing a space and sprinting through it
	- Basketball: Sprinting/Accel/Decel into a space to take advantage of gap/space on the court
- Transitioning to Offense and Defense
	- Quicker you can get set up between Off/Def, the quicker you can 
		- Turnaround and score, or
		- Defend against quick turnarounds
## Analyzing Player Performance Metrics
Sub-Max Speeds do **not** mean sub-max intent.
	Can still have really high forces, can have multiple changes of direction that are intent-focused / reactive.
Speed is playing faster and has high intensity components:
- Accelerating
- Decelerating
- Running @ High-Speed
- Sprinting @ V. High Speed
## Profiling the Game: Metrics and Context
What’s a FWD look like, versus a Guard? Different positions, different needs.
Profiling the Game:
- Volume: General volume without magnitude (time, reps, distance covered, etc.)
- Intensity: Mechanical (Start/Stop, Accel/Decel) or Neuromuscular (High-Speed Running, Max-Effort Outputs)
- Density: Volume, or Intensity/Time (dividing the components by how often/much they’re occuring)
- Performance: Outputs
Levels of Profiling:
- Lv. 1: Understanding Time, Reps, Plays
- Lv. 2: Internal Load: HR, RPE
- Lv. 3: External Load: GPS, etc.
## Profiling the Athlete: Technical vs Physical Factors
What determines Sprint Performance? — 40-60% Technical Factors, 15-30% Strength Qualities
“Optimal technique influenced by their unique strength profiling, blending hip ext. strength, ankle stiffness, and neuromusc. coordination.”
# Defining Strength Beyond Numbers
“Strength is an expression, not a measurement.” -[[Bobby Stroupe]]
Max Strength ≠ Max-Speed.
Absolute strength is a weaker link, but relative strength is slightly better (still not great, r=-0.37)
	Even when normalized, explains only ~14% of accel variance
### Bodyweight and Strength Correlation
Explosive Strength outweighs Max Strength almost all of the time
	In sport, GCT is super short. Not a lot of time to hit max-force, so RFD + Power is more important.
	CMJ Correlation (Jump Height/PWR) = Strong Predictor (r=-0.76)
## The Role of Eccentric Forces
Braking Forces: Capacity to Yields and Amortize Forces.
	Energy Leaks (Arch Collapse, Pronation)? Inability to Yield.
The best athletes can produce eccentric forces really fast. Is a big separator from sub-elite and elite.
	(connects to [[Cal Dietz]] and theory on speed of Relaxation)
## Tendons and the SSC
Faster SSC is more linked to tendons, while slower SSC is more connected to muscles.
	Want a steep slope to our RFD.
## Importance of Deceleration Forces
RSI = Jump Height / Contact Time. HIGHLY Correlated with Sprint Speed (r=-0.83)
	Reflects the efficiency of SSC, more predictive than just contact-time.
Ankle stiffness is key for this.
	Drives Hip Ext., FWD Propulsion. Critical in Early-Accel.
## Analyzing RSI
If you don’t have Ankle stiffness, you won’t have great hip extension. Going to act as a dampener.
### Natera-ISOS
Hip-Push Purpose: targeting the hip-extensors in sprint-specific positions. Measures ability to produce high ISO-Force in positions mimicking late-phase sprinting
Ankle-Push Purpose: Measure plantarflexors and foot-stiffness in sprint-specific ankles. Mimics ankle at ground-contact.
### Correlations
Sub-4.45 Threshold:
- >2.8 RSI
- 50cm CMJ
- 3.25 N/KG Hip-ISO
- 2.7 N/KG Ankle-ISO
# Profiling Model for Sprinting
![[Pasted image 20250910140753.png]]
Hip mobility was important (ER/IR, Flex/Extens.), Ankle Dorsiflexion too.
## Profiling Deep-Dive
### Physical Profiling
- Natera-ISOs: Unilateral Strength
	- Do you produce high-force through ankle, knee, and hip?
- 10-5 RSI: Reactive Strength
	- Do you produce force fast?
- Max STR: Trap-Bar, Belt-SQ, Natera IMTP
	- Do you produce high force in relation to bodyweight?
- CMJ: Power
	- Are you Powerful?
2-Axis Scatterplots: **CON vs ECC || PWR vs Speed**
	Reminds me of [[Daniel Bove]]’s Quadrant system.
