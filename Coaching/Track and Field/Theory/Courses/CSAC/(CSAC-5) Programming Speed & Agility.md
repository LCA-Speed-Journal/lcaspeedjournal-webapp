Everyone’s environment is different, so you need to act accordingly. 
	No two programs are going to rnu the exact same, because no two conditions are going to be the exact same.
## Start with the Timeline
Offseason, In-Season, an Annual Plan, etc.
## Move to an Individual Analysis
What’s the physical profile of the team/athlete?
## What are the Strengths/Weaknesses

## Define the Training Structure
How often are we training, how often are we doing each component, etc.
Want to avoid spiking volume and intensity together. Operate more like a wave.
- General Prep: Intro, +5-10% p/wk
- Specific Prep: Intro, Load, Deload, Peak
- Comp Prep: Intro, Load, Peak, Deload
# Examples of Weekly Structure
### Medium Days Potentiate High-Days: 
Medium — Accel — Pool or Low-Intensity — Potentiate / Tempo — MaxV — Recovery — Rest
### Begin the Week with Higher-Speed
MaxV — Potentiate — Pool or Low-Intensity — Accel — Potentiate / Tempo — Recovery — Rest
### Microdose Load across 3 Speed Days
Accel — Potentiate / Tempo — MaxV — Potentiate / Tempo — Accel — Recovery — Rest
### Two High-Days with one Individual Day (model used by [[Dan Pfaff]])
Accel — Potentiate / Tempo — MaxV — Pool or Low-Intens, — Potentiate — Indiv. Weakness — Rest
### Sport Examples
(Football Offseason) Accel — Multi-Directional — Recovery — MaxV — Conditioning
(Soccer, etc) Accel — Multi-Directional — Aerobic-Develop — MaxV — Conditioning — Aerobic-Develop
### In-Season Football
Intensive — Extensive — Speed — Taper — Perform — Recover — Complete Rest
Intensive = Strength, Extensive = Isos
# Examples of Daily Structure
## Speed Day
- Prehab / Movement Prep — Speed Prep
- Complexes — Plyos
- Med-Ball or Med-Ball + Strength (if Lift/Speed)
- Regen
## Short-Speed Day
- Prehab — Movement Prep — Speed Prep
- Complexes
- Regen
## Lift-Only
- Prehab — Movement Prep
- Med-Ball
- Strength
- Regen
# Drill Selection
The least important thing out of everything.
## Prehab
Massage (LaX Ball or fRoller)
Stretch (Ankle-Series, AIS/PNF, or Table)
Activate (Torso, Spinal-Engine, Individual-Work)
## Movement Prep (can be additional, but good prehab can cover this)
Mini Bands (Ground-Series, Standing Series)
Dynamic Warmup (Thermo, Dynamic Stretches, Backwards Series)
Neural Stuff (Pogos, Frequency, Plyos)
## Spellman Warmup Protocol

# Program Design (see[[(CSAC-5) Programming Speed & Agility| CSAC-5]])
## Timeline
- Early-Offseason (1-3wks post-season) — Restoration, General Prep
- Early-Offseason (3wks post-season) — Improve Weaknesses on Profile, Maintain Strength #1 Drivers
- Late-Offseason (6wks before season) — Improve Strengths on Profile, starting to Balance / get more Specific
- Preseason (3wks before season) — Comp-Specific Maintenance
- In-Season (minimal effective dose) — Competing, Maintain qualities and stay healthy (more restoration)

## STR/Weaknesses
Use FVP, determine if Force-Deficient, Balanced, or Velocity-Deficient
![[Separating Groups by Deficiency]]
## Training Structure
(exact same chart as [[(CSAC-5) Programming Speed & Agility#Define the Training Structure| CSAC-5: Training Structure]])
1-Day Model: Primary Weakness — also Asym / Body-Comp when feasible
2-Day Model: Weakness / Strength — also Asym / Body-Comp when feasible
3-Day Model: Weakness / Strength / Weakness — also Asym / Body-Comp when feasible

### Acute Training Adjustments
1. Initial-Monitoring — Wellness, HRV, Physical-Screening, Body-Language
2. Training-Demands — Volume, Intensity, Density
	Higher than planned? adjust following sessions
3. Total-Athlete Response — RPE-Scale, Visible Fatigue
	Poor response? adjust future sessions
