# Acceleration
- Angular Velo
	- Pulling from behind the foot to over-the-top is the big one here. Yuris do this, but can mimic with other things as well.
- Common Flaws (Team-Sport)
	- Vertical Push: Too-Upright. Fix with Heavy Resisted, External Constraints, or cueing a "Drive Away from the line, explode at your target."
	- Hip/Trunk Flex: Crunched Over. Fix with Short Resisted (but caution), Heavy Sleds, MB Accels/Projections, focusing the 1st Step (from a half-kneeling), and cueing a "proud chest."
- Creating Falling
	- Acceleration is "Falling with Intent, and Landing in Control." Need to get Extension-Strength out of our Toes, helps bring our center of pressure (CoP) more to the forefoot, where the elites live.
- Cueing Leg
	- #1 cue (Korfist) is to push off the back leg, develop a false step, etc.
	- Block back leg up on a wall, push off to get front shin to drop
- First Step
	- Reverse Hyper translates best for first step (SL Reverse-Hyper ISO-Push was the most ideal format)
	- Start Propulsion Band (Band anchored behind, check Cal's YT). ISO-Pushes, OSC Reps, etc. Hand matching the FWD Foot is facing down. 
- Posture
	- Remember, we need the mass out in front of the engine (i.e. the butt). If it's behind, we're behind, and if we're behind, we're slow.
- Programming
	- Korfist only did 1x Fly-10 day in the season, priority was Accel for entire first block
