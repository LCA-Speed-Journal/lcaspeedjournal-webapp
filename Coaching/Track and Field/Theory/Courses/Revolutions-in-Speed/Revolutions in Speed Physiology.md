# [[Physiology]]
- [[Adductor Magnus]]
	- Adductor-Magnus is a Hip-Extensor, is the dominant muscle in female sprinters. Can train this doing a Straight-Leg Hip-Extension but with foot turned in.
- Foot Turn-In:
	- Turning the foot in activates the Posterior [[Glute-Med]], allows for more training of hip ext.
- Injury Risk for Hamstring:
	- Opposite glute and hip-rotators are all weak when the hamstring blows, usually same side tib, [[TFL]] are also off
- Important Muscles:
	- [[Rectus-Femoris]], [[Semitendinosis]]: Key. They need >7m/s to be fully activated, so drills need to be done at speed.
- Preferences for Specific Muscles:
	- [[Bicep Femoris]] likes speed, not load. Glute-Med likes both. Hip-Flexors loves High-Force.
- Critique on Nordics
	- Nordics are not built to train the Biceps-Femoris. It doesn't deal with that kind of load, and it doesn't like working like that, so can actually make things worse.
- Propulsion
	- [[Gastroc]] is the main muscle that propels, the Hamstrings and Glute-Med are the Acccelerators.
- Soccer-Example: great stabilization from neck-up, but tend to have excessive forward-lean
- Sprinter-Physiology
	- [[Semitendinosis]] was the only hamstring muscle that was bigger in sprinters, and the bicep-femoris has much higher activation at speed.
- The [[TFL]]
	- Gives the Hip IR, seen as the most important muscle for high-performance (almost above the psoas)
