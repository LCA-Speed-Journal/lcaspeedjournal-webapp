# [[Muscle Tonus]]
- Basic Theory
	- "Muscle tonus (resting tension) more responsible for sharp performance decline than ""fatigue"" might be. 
	- Address for higher potential volume,"
- Fixing Tone
	- Tonus too High? do a faster stretch or a drop-based exercise. 
	- Tonus too Low? OVC ISOs or Short Concentric work.
- Intra-Set [[RPR]]
	- "Cal uses a gun, but hands work. Helps tonus lower as set # increases. Target muscles of primary patterns, then perform next set. 
	- Timing is pre-speed/quality, post-conditioning."
- Scap/Knee
	- Control through the scap / kneecap helps disctate stability and the speed of repositioning. If these go, things deteriorate.  
	- As Korfist said, "if your mid-back goes bad? You're fucked."
