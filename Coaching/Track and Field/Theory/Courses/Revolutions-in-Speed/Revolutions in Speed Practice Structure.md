# Practice Structure
- Dynamic Power Potentiation: Combining short [[OVC ISOs]] (1-3s) to prime a pattern
- Functional Contrast Transfer: Combine [[Performance Pattern Cycling]] with [[Contrast Sets]] 
	- Ex. Quad → R. Hyper (or staggered RDL) → Yuri → Prime-Time
- Fly-10 Tweaking: Korfist says they’re great for young/novice athletes, but beyond that, acceleration is the real money-maker.
	- In Application: Korfist only drilled 0-5m for the first 3wks at HF
- More on [[Performance Pattern Cycling]]: Pair antagonists and agonists
	- Don’t want to force quad-dominance, so balance with something like Back-SQ → Heavy Resisted [[Chuck-Berry Walks]].
		- Do this is **not** hitting a specific need int he workout.
- [[Skill-Drill-Sport]]: Spans the spectrum of Low → High in the following areas
	- Predictability
	- Control
	- Simplicity of Outcome
	- Closed/Open
	- Single/Multi-Task
	- Inter-Rep Variability
- [[Skill-Drill-Sport]]: Definitions
	- Skills: component Parts
	- Drills: Accels/MaxV/COD
	- Sport: things like mirroring, evading, putting things together organically
