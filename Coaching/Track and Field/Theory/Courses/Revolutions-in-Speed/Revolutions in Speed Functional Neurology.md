# [[Functional Neurology]] Concepts
- ABC's of Sprinting: Acceleration → Brainstem → Cerebellum.
- Brain-Friendly
	- Working with good hand-positions (not double-pronated), doing SL work over bilateral work, doing performance pattern cycling, all are brain friendly
- Can't Get to Inside of Foot? Torque the leg into IR, tape counterclockwise about 2" superior to the ankle (calcaneus)
- Competing Better
	- Competition Creates Comfort in Stress. If we can perform better under stress, we perform better in the game.
- Design Fluency
	- Change command, match reps to things like light (strobe), tone (this one was super cool), primes the speed of the ECC/CON to be more reactive.
- Drills
	- "Eyes-Closed A-Skip (can also work into a neuro-cycle like a cerebellum-drill → one-sided audio stim → eyes-closed A-skip → curved sprint).
	- Curved sprints are huge for brain activation."
- Error Augmentation
	- Training towards the error (if issues with too flexed, pull further into flexion)
- Faster Recovery: Methods
	- "3x Sharp Nasal Inhale (""sniffling""), breathe out while slightly rattling teeth (low hum will do this), 
	- then do something to widen vision (avoid phone, object-focus, need to expand to periphery)"
- Forward Lean
	- "Slightly forward lean before doing things like pulldowns (if feet anchored) helps engage more toe-extension. 
	- Alternately (or additionally), can block up big-toe to simulate a lean with the brain."
- Rebalancing after Bilateral ("Need to Back-Squat?)
	- Can reset the functional pattern by doing an exaggerated march after the set (resets nervous system and rebalances patterning)"
- Reflexes
	- Unilateral paterns work well for this, do banded work as the opposite action on the opposing side to get greater activation.
- Relaxation Speed
	- "Want faster relaxation, we need to do high-velocity strength (get the SSC to work while exerting force). 
	- Shock/Plyo enhances transfer, but doesn't create relaxation."
- Speed Basics
	- "Speed lives in the place between what the brain ignites and what it silences."
	- Speed is also pattern-recognition, as if you can't predict, you can't perform.
- Sub-Threshold Stimulation
	- Demo with white-noise, doing an eyes-closed SL RDL. 
	- High-Volume was bad, No-Volume was Bad, but somewhere in the middle (tweaked for a bit) was actually helpful."
- Surround Inhibition
	- Shift focus to visual and distal-proprioceptive, and pain will reduce.
- Toe-Extension
	- "Tricks brain into thinking it's got a lean. 
	- Lean into a wall with toes blocked up, go until toes grab. Do 20 reps."
- Trusting the Ground
	- "Training the Cerebellum through balance-drills. 
	- Ex. adding an angle through things like a slant-board, doing plyos/jumps for accuracy, all these help the brain trust the ground-contact."
