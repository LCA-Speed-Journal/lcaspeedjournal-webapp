# [[ACL Non-Contact]]
## Failure Points: [[Slings]]
- Spiral Sling Fails — Tib-Anterior → TFL → Lower TVA → TVA → Delts.
- Lateral Sling Fails — Arch → Tib-Post → Bicep-Femoris → Glute-Med → QL → Lats
## Deep Tissue Work
- Massage Day-Of? No. Day Before? Sure — Same goes for foam-rolling.
## Masking
- Collapsing Arch hides beneath what initially presents as a bad glute. Arches can also be foot bones, can adjust the cuboid (look up adjustment)
## Patterns
- Foot strikes, but no stability. This isn't something that can be trained out, as it just exacerbates existing compensations and can make the problem worse.
