# Chapter 4 — Functional Anatomy
- Axial Skeleton — head, spine, down to the tailbone
- Appendicular Skeleton — shoulders down to hands, and hips down to feet
- “Pronation” — Going with Gravity (trunk flexion, etc.)
- “Supination” — Going against Gravity (trunk extension, etc.)
## Fundamental Human Movement
Quadrant — Static y-Axis, Dynamic (gait) x-Axis
- Up — 4-Quadrant Supination (going against gravity, or standing up)
- Down — 4-Quadrant Pronation (going with gravity, or sitting down)
- Left — Contra/reciprocal pronation/supination
	- lower right, upper left pronation — lower left, upper right supination
- Right — Contra/reciprocal pronation/supination
	- lower left, upper right pronation — lower right, upper left supination
## Lower Quadrants — Pronation and Supination
- Pronation
	- Foot — “collapsing of the arch” is the cover-all, not worried about all the micro-actions
	- Knee — Extension
	- Hip — Flexion, internal rotation
- Supination
## Upper Quadrants — Pronation and Supination
- Pronation — 
	- Scap — protraction, upward rotation, and elevation
	- Shoulder — internal rotation, flexion, and abduction
	- 
- Supination —
## Axial Skeleton — Joint Actions
- Going Right — twisting and counter-twisting, bending and counter-bending
	- Right Lower quadrant swings, strikes ground — force goes into the pelvis
		- R Lumbar side-bend as hip shifts up (ground strikes back)
		- L Thoracic counteracts this (keep eyes level to horizon by balancing out)
		- R cervical side-bend acts as final corrector (to keep head level)
	- Rotational Components
		- Pelvis turns right
		- L lumbar turns to counteract this
		- R thoracic twists
		- L cervical twist acts as final corrector (keeps head straight-on)
	- Pelvic Tilt — anterior/posterior (L vs R)
