# Chapter 3 — The Human Movement System
## Structural Components
- Base component is the nervous system (CNS and Peripheral)
- Muscles are receiving input from nervous system to tell muscle to contract or relax
- Articular is the tissues that comprise the joints
Structural is largely the concern of the medical field — orthos, neuro, etc. 
	People looking at tissue integrity and quality.
## Functional Components
- Motor Control — Creation/Coordination of Patterns, Tissue Signaling (sensory input → motor output), and planar-specific joint actions
- Motor Patterns — multiple joint-actions working together, breaks into static balance (get upright) and dynamic balance (gait)
- Motor Learning — acquisition/refinement/transference of new motor skills to the real world (exercise)
Not a lot of people working on control/patterns, largely focused on the learning. Square1 tries to hit those two more “foundational” pieces to help add to the front end and make learning more efficient and effective.
## Compensation
- When there’s high integrity of tissue (no fractures, etc), tend to have good signaling.
	- When there’s optimal signaling, have more control and precision of patterns.
	- Unfortunately, not reality.
- If there’s tissue damage or other stress on the system (even something like a stubbed toe), there’s an alteration of the signals.
	- What this means to Square1 is that certain tissues/joints are no longer able to tolerate load in certain patterns.
## Replacement Strategies
Any strategy that increases performance of sub-optimal outcomes through task oriented activities (exercise).
- If it’s tight, loosen it
- If it’s weak, strengthen it
Generally quick/easy to implement, but might leave the practitioner wanting more, because it doesn’t get in front of or directly address compensations. Fixing only at the surface can lead to more distortions down at the base.
## Restoration Strategies
A strategy in which lost resources are regained to produce more optimal movement outcomes.
- Looking for motor control deficits
	- can reduce and remove them, which fixes compensations
- Very complete approach to helping movement outcomes — all about reducing compensation
