# Chapter 9 — Square1 Level 2
## Triggers
Trigger is just stress, any stim that takes a system out of balance
- Provoke the Body, draw out a deeper layer of compensation
- Low-Grade Fight or Flight
### Examples
- Hyperventilation
- Squats
- Throw a Baseball
- Think Nasty Thoughts about Prior Injuries
### A Fresh Patient
A stimuli that matches what they’ll be doing on a day-to-day
- First Line tends to be Breathing
	- Breathe Nasally, through Mouth, shallow/fast, deep/slow
	- Generally start — big inhale/exhale through mouth (3x) while touching ribs (give ext. force)
- Second Line tends to be Squat-Pattern
	- Regressed Squat — Supine on Table, bring knees to chest, practitioner gives light tap to feet
	- Getting in and out of a Chair
	- Bodyweight Squat (holding onto something)
	- Bodyweight Squat + ISO at the bottom
	- Bodyweight SQ + weight-shift at the bottom
	- Can add a jump
	- Can do things to a box, from a box
	- Can do split-squats, lunges
	- Can do with eyes closed
Once you’ve cleared all these things, a third line: “the client’s symptom” — aches and pains and tightness
- Want to mimic this **safely** — don’t go after things you think have damage if they haven’t been seen yet
- First Step — Conscious focus on the pain
- Second Step — touch on the area of pain
- Third Step — external touch on the area (practitioner touches the spot)
- Fourth Step — have patient perform activities of daily living that provoke pain
- Fifth Step — Sensory Challenges (close your eyes, head turn while walking, etc.)
- Sixth Step — Perform activities that are similar to the pain-producing pattern, but aren’t identical
	- If overhead is pain, then stops working — add a rotation, add ab/adduction
## Considerations
### Personal Title
if you’re not a medical professional, not diagnosing or treating structural.
- Restoring organization, motor control, etc.
- High likelihood that many outcomes will improve, but you’re not framing as treating/diagnosing
### Medically Named Conditions — Stenosis
- For individuals with this condition — Square1 can actually exacerbate these symptoms
	- Background — narrowing of the foramen (nerve roots in vertebrae), could be bony spurs
	- Theory — intense level of compensation under the surface, when removing the need to compensate, but if compensation was a protective mechanism, can make pain worse
### Working with Clients with Recent Trauma
- Some time in the last 4-6wks, haven’t seen a medical professional — refer out first, before treating
	- Want to be sure on structural damage, don’t want to end up getting in trouble regarding practicing medicine without a license

# A Practical Full-Length Demo
## Patient A
### Start with Inquiry
- Ask for recent injuries, things that have been nagging them
- This Patient: 
	- Knee-Swelling, long-founded injury but recurred when playing pickup
	- Erector Tightness, exacerbated by Lumbar Flexion
### Finding an Indicator Test
- Starting with the Glute-Med, feeling what “a solid test” feels like
	- Slight Abduction, 10-15º, then resist
- Moved to Glute-Min — client passed ER, and passed IR
> [!NOTE] Applying Stress, then Re-Testing
> Instead of moving to another, apply a low-grade stress, then re-test. 
> - Hyperventilation while pressing on sternum — Patient still passed all 3 tests.
> - Moved to a BW Squat — Patient still passed all 3 tests.
> - Moved to a squat with hip-shift towards the bad-knee — fails Glute-Min + ER on R Leg
> 	- (Lateral or Posterior Division of the Glute Minimus)
### Reset vs Compensatory
R Ankle Dorsiflexion — stays failing (compensatory-phase)
L Ankle Dorsiflexion — solid (reset-phase)
### Circuit Locating
Starting at the R Knee (as client prompted) — no change
R Ankle — no change
**L Hip — Fail**
L Knee (checking to make sure) — no change
### Ground-Reaction Force
Starting to think of the problem as a pronation issue.
	Hip — saggital flex, frontal adduct, transv IR
L Hip Adduct — solid response
**L Hip Flexion — Fail**
L Hip IR — solid response
### ISO-Intervention
No resistance, client squeezes into hip-flexion for 4-6s at 40%
**Test the same Indicator Test — pass**
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 2
(Use the same trigger until it doesn’t cause the Indicator Test to fail anymore.)
Anything relating to R Step (R Dorsi, L Knee Extens, L shoulder-flex, R fist-squeeze) all fail.
- NOT Chasing this.
- Instead, chasing the **isolated** failure. What part of L Step is the “isolated weak link”
	- Going back to L Hip — hip flexion doesn’t fail anymore, adduct doesn’t fail, but **IR Does.**
	- Do the ISO-Intervention, then feed what was previously compensatory (R Step)
		- R Dorsi, L Knee Ext., L Shoulder-Flex, R Fist — all pass now
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 3
Cleared a second layer with Hip IR (Layer 1 = Hip Flexion), coming back for #3.
- R Leg Glute-Min + ER Fails again, after the low-grade stressor
	- Absence of pain doesn’t mean there isn’t a brain-related stress-pattern
- L Hip passes — moving to L Knee and R Hip
	- High tendency that the next issue is within one step away (joint, side-mirroring, etc)
- **L Lumbar Spine — Fail**
	- Frontal Plane — Creating side-bend by dragging legs to side — pass
	- **Transverse Plane — pop up the R hip — Fail**
		- ISO-Intervention — hold the right hip up
		- Feed the pattern — R dorsiflexion
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 4
Cleared a third layer with Transverse-Lumbar (Layer 1 = L Hip Flexion, Layer 2 = L Hip IR), now to #4.
- Now failing in L Step — chasing R Step now
	- Last area was lumbar, test mirrored side
	- Move one joint away — hips (L pass, R fail)
		- Flexion, IR, Adduction, in whatever order you want to check it
		- Flexion Pass, Adduct Pass, **IR Fail**
			- ISO-Intervention (same as L Hip, just other side)
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 5
Cleared fourth layer with R Hip IR (1 = L Hip Flex, 2 = L Hip IR, 3 = Trans. Lumb, 4 = R Hip IR), now #5.
- Solid with R Step, Fail with L Step — chasing R Step
	- Re-check R Hip — solid
	- Move to L Hip + R Knee — fail
		- **Narrow to Knee — flexion causes the fail**
		- ISO-Intervention (ISO Leg-Curl), then re-test to make sure we pass, then more stressor
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 6
Cleared 5 layers now (1-2: Hip, 3 = Transv. Lumb, 4 = Hip-IR, 5 = Knee-Flex), returning to the well for our low-grade test
- Test + Shift no longer causes the fail to come up on our Indicator Test
	- Move to squats but all reps skewed to one side (instead of squat, then shift)
	- Still Passes, move to a couple SL Hops (yielding) — new trigger
- R Dorsiflexion solid, L step fail — chasing R Step
	- Narrow to R Hip
	- **Narrow to R Hip Flexion**
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 7
Cleared 6 Layers now
- After fix, client can do SL hops without triggering, can take them higher without triggering
- Quicker hops (i.e. jump-rope cue) creates a trigger now
Back on the table:
- L Toes Squeeze,  L Hip Adduct, R Hip Abduct — all fails
- Back into chasing R Step — knees and hips are good, but lumbar spine (R side now) is fail
	- Lumbar side-bend passes, transverse passes
	- Flexion/Extension — need to cock R foot into dorsiflexion before testing
	- **R Lumbar Flexion is causing the fail**
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 8
- Testing side-hops, FWD/BKWD line-hops — pass
- 2-Step Approach Jump — creates new trigger
Back on the Table:
- L Dorsiflexion is solid, R fail — chasing L Step
- Narrow to Left-Step T-Spine
	- Frontal Plane — client creates side-bend, pass
	- Flexion/Extension — cock L into dorsi, **L T-Spine Extens (proud chest) creates fail**
	- ISO-Intervention, then re-test — 2-step approach still creating trigger
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 9, 10
- 2-Step Approach still creating trigger
Back on the Table:
- Right-Step, touching the belly causes fail — L-Hip lumbar
	- Lumbar Side-Bend passes, Transverse Plane Fails (popping up the L Hip)
- Trigger, Re-Test, back in the same area — saggital now
	- Arch Low-Back while cocking foot into dorsiflexion
- Trigger, Re-Test, not failing anymore
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 11
Adding sensory stimulus into the trigger now — squat pattern as before, but eyes-shut
Chasing L Step, Right Hip (thinking supination, since contralateral)
- Fail happening at Hip-Extension (practitioner hand behind leg, client presses into table)
### Finish with Post-Test Triggering
Re-trigger same pattern that was causing pain (flexion of spine)
Client reports tightness has minimized (slight in lumbar, but thoracic totally gone)
## Patient B
### Start with Inquiry
- Ask for recent injuries, things that have been nagging them
- This Patient: 
	- No reported symptoms, aches or pains, etc. Little bit of neck tightness.
	- Nothing standing out as super eggregious
	- Teset will be mostly just showing the steps of the system
### Finding an Indicator Test
- Starting with the Glute-Med, feeling what “a solid test” feels like
	- Slight Abduction, 10-15º, then resist
- Moved to Glute-Min — L Leg + ER Fails
### Reset vs Compensatory
- L Ankle Dorsi — Pass (Reset Phase)
	- R Knee Ext = Solid
	- R Cervical Rotation = Solid
- R Ankle Dorsi — Fail (Compensatory Phase)
	- L Knee Ext = Fail (same motor-chain)
	- L Cervical Rotation = Solid
### Circuit Locating
- Hips — Solid
- Hands on Belly + Ribs — Solid
- Hands on Neck + Chin — Solid
- Hands on Eyes + Top-of-Head — Fail
- **Touch Top of Head — Fail**
	- Tells us it’s in the capitus region
### Ground-Reaction Force
- Dorsi + Capitus Flexion (tip chin down) — Pass
- Dorsi + Capitus Extension (tip chin up) — Fail
### ISO-Intervention
Hold chin-back at 40% for 3-6sec
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 2
- Jumped to a higher stressor, as this patient has experience — eyes closed squat + weight-shift
	- Still wasn’t triggering.
- Rubbing the area on the neck that was described as being gently tight — enough to trigger
- L Dorsi now Failing, R Dorsi Passing (our reset vs compensatory has flipped, going after R Step)
- Touching Adjacent Joints — touching neck and ribs fails
	- Narrows the focus to neck (R Step, Cervical Region)
- Checking the Cervical R Step — Turn head to the L (the skew), then flex/extend
	- Extension (pushing into table) caused fail
	- ISO Intervention – press head into mat for 3-5s at 40% effort
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 3
- Touching the neck again, causes re-trigger
	- L Step solid, R Step fails — going back to chasing the L step motor-chain
- Chin + Head — pass
- Ribs — Pass
- Scapulae — Fail
	- Narrow to R Scap — since L Step, looking at elevation, protraction, upward rotation
- Shrug Up — pass
- Pop towards Ceiling — pass
- Arm Overhead — fail
	- ISO Intervention (just ISO-force in that arm overhead position)
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 4
- Touching the neck again, causes re-trigger
	- L Step solid, R Step fails — continue chasing the L step motor-chain
- Try testing scap — pass
- Touching neck — fail
	- Since L Step Cervical, can be R Cervical Rotation, Flexion, Extension, or L lateral Side Bend
- Fail with Slight tip to L, while doing lateral side-bend
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 5
- Touching the neck again, causes re-trigger
	- L Step solid, R Step fails — still chasing the L step motor-chain
- Circuit-Locate lead to R Scap causes fail again
	- Elevation, Protraction, Upward Rotation — narrow to protraction
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 6
- Touching the neck again, causes re-trigger
	- R Step solid, L Step fails — switching to chasing the R step motor-chain
- R Scap, Neck — Pass
- Ribs — Fail (T-Spine Problem)
	- Flexion (baby-crunch) — narrowed fail
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 7
- Touching the neck again, causes re-trigger
	- L Step solid, R Step fails — switching to chasing the L step motor-chain
- Ribs —Fail 
	- Narrow to R Thoracic Side-Bend (reaching R hand down leg towards the knee)
### Low-Grade Stressor and Repeat — Layer 8
- Touching the neck isn’t triggering with the client touching it
	- Shawn touches the area instead, and even tho he was lighter touch, still re-triggered
-  L Step solid, R Step fails — switching to chasing the L step motor-chain
- Ribs — pass
- Belly and Neck — pass
- R Scap — Fail
	- Shrug pass, protract pass, overhead extension fail
