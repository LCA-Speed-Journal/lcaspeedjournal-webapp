# Chapter 6 — Steps of the Square1 System
## General Outline
1. Establish an Indicator Test
2. Accurately Discern between Reset and Compensatory Phase
3. Use Circuit Locating to find the flawed/dysfunctional Joint
4. Mimic Ground-Reaction at the specific level of joint-action
5. ISO-Intervention
6. Check Your Work
7. Attempt to Trigger a Stress Reaction — draw out deeper layers of compensation
## Indicator Test
Two criteria that need to be satisfied to be an indicator test.
- 1) Needs to Fail the Test
- 2) Failed Test *can’t* be failing due to discomfort or pain
### Practically ID-ing an Indicator Test
- Shawn likes to start with glute-med without IR/ER — test position that will likely pass
- Shawn’s next go-to is the glute-min with ER — usually a place people fail
## Reset vs Compensatory Phase
Reset Phase: the phase that’s housing the joint dysfunction (or the GRF-intolerant joint-action)
- Joint actions producing a passed response.
Compensatory Phase: identifiable by a negative neuro-response by force on the action constituting that joint-phase
- Joint actions producing a failed response.
### Example: 
- imposes GRF force on R ankle (dorsiflexion), response test is a pass → Go to left ankle and see a fail. 
	- R Step (r ankle dorsif. is consistent with right step) — Solid response would be the reset pattern. 
	- L ankle dorsiflexion is the failed test, left would be the compensatory. 
- Tells us that the joint-actions corresponding to left-step (knee flexion, hip IR, R cervical, R scap depression, etc) are going to produce negative neuro-response results. 
	- When we mimic R GRF, nearly all those joint-actions should produce solid responses.
### Going through a Demo:
Shawn-Tip: New students should start with ankle dorsiflexion.
- OG Failure — L glute min.
- GRF on left ankle, passes the test. GRF on the right ankle, fails the test again.
	- L Step is the reset pattern, R Step is the compensatory pattern.
	- Test to solidify: L cervical rotation fails, R cervical rotation passes. 
		- Consistent with the idea that L Step is the reset, R Step is the compensatory.
## Circuit Locating
Circuit Locating (also called therapy localization, more of an applied-KIN term). The latter term is more for those who have a license, the former is more for regular folks like strength-coaches.
- Just trying to pinpoint where the motor-signaling deficit is, the thing driving the compensation.
Various regions throughout the body to help locate where the signaling deficit is.
- Touching on an area and the response passes? For ID-ing the driver, tells us it’s not in that area
- Looking for the areas that can be touched and then the test fails.
	- Receptors are everywhere — bones, muscles, skin, etc. Touch is just helping ID what joint is housing the deficit.
### Going through a Demo:
L post glute-min is the indicator test — R dorsi makes it fail, L dorsi makes it pass.
- L Step is the reset phase, R step is the compensatory.
#### Going Joint-By-Joint
- Grabbing the toes — pass
- Grabbing the feet — pass
- **Tapping both knees — caused a failure**
	- Second pass after hitting all bilaterals — touch an individual knee
		- R knee pass, **L knee fail**
- Tapping the Hips — pass
- Client touches stomach and ribs — pass
- Client touching throat and chin — pass
- Client touching top of head and eyes — pass
- Client touches both shoulder blades — pass
- Client grabs upper-arms (glenohumeral joint) — pass
- Client touches both elbows — pass 
- Client touches both wrists — pass
- Client touches palms/fingers together — pass
## Pinpoint GRF-Intolerant Action
Need to mimic GRF to pinpoint what joint-action that the brain is perceiving as a threat.
### Back to our Demo
Previous ID — the issue is in the L-Knee (within L step)
- Need to mimic in 2 planes (knee is hinge-joint, so don’t need to ab/adduct it)
Knee Flexion — pass
**Internal tibial Rotation — fail**
- the most recent reason why client needs to compensate
## Isometric Intervention
Brain perceives specific actions as intolerant — poor or compromised sensorimotor signaling
- Want to increase drive to the tissues that drive the joint actions that brain is saying are load-intolerant
### Back to our Demo
This Client: practitioner chasing after L Step, in the L knee, when tibial internal rotation is applied.
ISO Intervention: 90deg knee-bend, heel on ground, turn foot in as far as possible.
- Give 10-50% effort for 5-6sec.
## Checking Your Work
Want to find out if the intervention used actually helps fix the compensation.
Go back, test after the intervention, make sure it’s solid. Try some other tests further up the chain that would previously be triggering, test to make sure it’s solid.
## Triggering Stress Responses
Want to create a low-grade stress response to bring out deeper layers of compensation.
- Set of Squats — 1-2 reps, bodyweight, full-ROM
	- Want to see if the pattern re-triggers
- Hyperventilation with load on the ribcage (hand on the diaphragm) — 3-4 fast breaths
- Biting the Tongue — created a failure
	- Creates temporary chaos — repeat steps 1-6 to clear out the threat at a deeper level
	- Client was now failing in R Step — compensatory and reset swapped at the deeper level
