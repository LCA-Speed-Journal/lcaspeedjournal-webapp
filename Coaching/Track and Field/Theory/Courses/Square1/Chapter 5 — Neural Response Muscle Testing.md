# Chapter 5 — Neural Response Muscle Testing
## History
- OG idea was how to isolate muscle-groups with patients who have restrictions — trying to figure what needs to strengthen
- Development (Goodhart) — muscle tests weak doesn’t mean much, because altered environment / pattern may actually change the strength of this 
	- (could be linked to the pattern, not the soft-tissue — nervous-system problem rather than structural problem)
## Concepts
- Creating a testing-stimulus that makes a previously strong muscle respond as weak — evaluating the pattern based on what it turns off
## Muscle Testing

## Response Tests
Five tests used off (glute med x3, glute min x2)
- Glute Med (middle-division) — good starting point because clients aren’t likely to fail
	- Good to let the client know what a “strong” response is
	- Position leg 30deg abducted, client stiffens the leg, practitioner applies adduction-force (client resists by applying abduction-force)
	- More of a way to introduce the concept of neuro-response muscle testing to the client (again, as most will pass)
- Glute Med (lateral division) — same test, just an external-rotation to the leg
- Glute Med (anterior division) — same as middle, but an internal-rotation to the leg
- Glute Min (anterior division) — practitioner likes elbow at 30deg angle, lift leg to this point (should be ~30deg), move leg to 30deg abduction
	- maximize internal rotation, resist outward
- Glute Min (posterior division) — as anterior, but maximize external rotation
Lots of other tests, nothing special about those 5, but testing on big structures that are involved in gait, tends to be safe positions to test people in, while letting practitioner be more in tune (longer lever means practitioner needs to apply less force)
- like to test bigger structures in the hips, becaus they’re resistant to repeated testing, less likely to fatigue as the practitioner keeps coming back to the test after repeated interventions
## Testing Tips
- Want to be careful about language used with the client — style of test that’s being used, not a force-production test but a neuro-response test
	- don’t want to use competitive language (let’s see how strong you are, win this test, etc.)
	- sets you up for frustrations, as you only need a few pounds of force to participate
- Give the client as little responsibility as possible — focus on just 2 responsibilities (rotational aspect and the resistance itself)
	- Cue the client to focus on the twisting (as far as you can, don’t stop trying to twist, etc.)
	- Work to maintain the position (I’m going to exert a force inward, guiding them on that path, explain that you’re trying to “bump them off position” and that they should just maintain)
- When in doubt, test lighter — common problem for brand-new testers is using too much force
	- Take a breath, step back, and try to go even gentler than you think — maintain sensititivity
- Hold a single question in the mind when testing a client — “Does it Grab?” or “Is it Crisp?”
- Patience — press lightly, wait for the feeling that the client is contracting
	- Just a few ounces to start, then ramp up once they begin to contract the muscle
	- If client doesn’t grab, don’t even need to do the full test
- Of all the tips, the rotational focus for the client is the biggest one
