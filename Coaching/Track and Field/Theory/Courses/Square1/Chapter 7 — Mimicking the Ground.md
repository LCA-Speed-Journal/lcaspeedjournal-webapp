# Chapter 7 — Mimicking the Ground
## GRF – Lower, Distal
- Toe-Flexion — hold under foot with one-hand, pull toes into flexion
	- Blocking the arch to isolate the toe-flexion
- Toe-Extension — thumb on top of foot, pull toes into extension
- Ankle (Plantarflex) — Grab heel, pull towards the knee, while also pulling fooot
- Ankle (Dorsiflex) — Grab at ball of foot, shove back into dorsiflexion
- Ankle (Inversion) — Grab toes, wrap fingers around outside edge of foot, roll into inversion, upper hand counter-rotates (“wringing out a washcloth” motion)
- Ankle (Eversion) — Grab under the heel, cock foot out into eversion, roll forefoot into inversion
- Flattening the Arch — lift up on fifth/first metacarpal, pulling up, use top of thumbs to push down along midline of foot
- Raising the Arch — opposite of flattening, pressing up onto the midline of the arch
## GRF – Lower, Proximal
- Knee (Extension) — push leg down just above the kneecap, can also pull up gently on ankle
- Knee (Flexion) — bring thigh up, below 90deg (not checking hips), then bring heel to butt
- Knee (tib IR) — as flexion, but thumb on inside of foot, internally rotate the shin
- Knee (tib ER) — as tib IR, but turning out
- Hip (Flexion) — shove knee towards the chest, without shoving heel to butt (not hitting knee flex at the same time)
- Hip (Extension) — slide hand under calf, give instruction of pressing hand into table
- Hip (Adduction) — raise opposite leg up and away, take leg and swipe underneath
- Hip (Abduction) — drag leg out to the side, go until soft end-feel
- Hip (IR) — take leg up, knee near 90deg, but hip below 90. Bring leg out to the side
- Hip (ER) — as IR test, but bring leg towards midline
## GRF – Lumbo-Pelvic; Thoracic
- Lumbar (Frontal, side-bend) — grab the ankles/feet, slide them out to R or L
- Lumbar (Transverse, R Pelvic Rotation) — cue “pop the bony part of the hip to the ceiling”
- Lumbar (Saggital, Pelvic Tilt) — a little trickier
	- to mimic R step Lumbar-Extens., cock R foot into dorsif., cue client to keep butt on ground and arch low-back (or can place hand and say “give me space under here“)
	- to mimic R step Lumbar-Flex, do same thing but 
- Thoracic (Side-Bend) — keep both shoulders on ground, cue client to lean R or L
- Thoracic (Flexion/Extens) — feed input like with pelvic-tilt, cock a foot into dorsi, then cue proud chest for extens, “baby crunch” for extension
## GRF – Cervical and Above
- Cervical (Saggital) — flexion is, keeping shoulders on table, just picking head up off table, flexion is pressing into the table
- Cervical (Frontal, tilt) — tilt head to the R or L
- Cervical (Transverse, rotational) — twist head to the R or L
- Capitus (Saggital) — chin to chest, or to ceiling
- Jaw (Saggital, flession) — jaw open or close
- Jaw (Transverse, R or L deviation) — slide jaw to R or L
- Eyes (down for flexion, up for extension, L and R for L and R steps)
## GRF – Upper, Proximal
- Scap (Elevation/Depression)
- Scap (Protraction)
- Scap (Downward Rotation) — squeeze elbow to side
- Scape (Upward Rotation) – arm abduct up to ear
- Glenohumeral (Flexion) — arm overhead or into ground
- Glenohumeral (Horiz. Abd/Add)
- Glenohumeral (ER/IR)
## GRF – Upper, Distal
- Elbow (Flex/Extens)
- Wrist (Flex/Extens)
- Wrist (Radial Dev/Ulnar Dev) — hammer-grip, thumb tips up for radial, thumb tips down for ulnar
- Wrist (IR/ER) — 
- Hand (Supination) — Big Splayed Palm
- Hand (Pronation) — Cupping the Palm
