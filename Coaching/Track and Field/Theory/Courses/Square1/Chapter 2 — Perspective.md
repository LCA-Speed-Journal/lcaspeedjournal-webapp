# Chapter 2 — Perspective
- Shouldn’t always be trusting our Eyes
	- Rely too heavily on “the outer world view” of movement
	- Example: hip-flexion restriction. Can assume we need to activate flexors and release extensors, but that might not work. Maybe it’s an impingement, where tissue itself is compressing to protect against that range of motion.
## Complexity of the Human Movement System
- A lot of wasted time trying to find the right “corrective exercises” to solve a problem
	- Seeing the symptoms, but the cause can come from so many different places it can be hard to nail down
## Puzzle Pieces
### Top-Level Pyramid
Athleticism — components like speed, power, bounce. 
Fitness — components like muscular strength, endurance, cardio-endurance, flexibility/mobility.
Movement (Structural and Functional)
### Movement Pyramid — Structural
Articular (top-level) — Muscular — Nervous
### Movement Pyramid — Functional
Motor Learning — how the body acquires, refines, and transfers motor patterns into the real world
- Mostly practice by practicing motor patterns
Motor Patterns — multiple joint actions working together to accomplish a task
Motor Control — how the body coordinates movement patterns
