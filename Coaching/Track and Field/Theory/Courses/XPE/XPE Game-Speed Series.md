# Week 1 — 
- Villani agrees that “Acceleration is King”
	- Never quit targeting acceleration, even if there are other needs
- Jumping and Flying-Sprints are primarily “Vertical” (so is lifting)
	- Leads to a lot of athletes being horizontal deficient — short accels, resisted sprints, etc.
### Three Buckets:
- Force — Broad-Jump
	- Heavy SQ, Broad-Jump Sticks, Prowler Pushes
- Explosion — 10yd Fly with a 5yd Build
- Form — 10yd Fly with a 20 or 30yd Build
	- Wall-Drills, Trap-Bar Jumps
# Week 2 — 
Start by taking 2-3wks to teach the fundamentals of how to jump, how to sprint, how to accelerate
From there, move into Performance Circuits (can start there if an athlete is already competent)
With tighter time-constraints, like track, need to start overloading sooner, yes,
	Can work the learning components into the warmups, all the time
## Weekly Schedule
### M — Mixing Speed + Legs (Early-Accel)
#### Overload Recipe
- Heavy SQ or Trap-Bar — 0.8m/s
- Broad Jump
- Wall Drill — Accel
- Sled or SHREDmill — 50-65% MaxV (or 40-50% vDec)
	- Equates to 70-80% BW
- Deload and 3-5 Step “Get Off” — 5yd Build + 10yd Fly
- Auxiliary Work
#### Deload Recipe
- SQ or DL — 1.1m/s
	- Alternately, Jumps Deload — Jump Up, Land Down
- Broad Jump + Bound-Bound
- Wall Drill — Accel
- Sled or SHREDmill — 75-85% MaxV (or 25-30% vDec)
	- Equates to 30-50% BW
- 25yd Run
- Brush up on Starts
### Th — Mixing Speed + Legs (Late-Accel + MaxV)
#### Overload Recipe
- Heavy Split-SQ — 0.8m/s
- Broad Jump + Bound-Bound
- Sled or SHREDmill — 75-85% MaxV (or 25-30% vDec)
	- Equates to 30-50% BW
- Deload and 15-20yd Sprint — 20yd Build + 10yd Fly
- Auxiliary Work — a little more help for things like hips, hamstrings, etc.
#### Deload Recipe
- Run 40’s
- Contrast Training and Jumps
- Altitude Drops or Lands
- SHREDmill Gera 3 Drops, or Lighter Sleds
- Do we Try to Fix Something?
## Rule of 2’s — Can’t Burn the Candle at Both Ends
- Speed and Power always first, and when fresh
- Condition at the end of the week, or end of session
	- (can’t do speed next day if you do this)
- Work in the learning as much as possible
### Track vs Combine Prep
- Define each
- Suggest Schedule for each
	- Is the schedule practical for you?
- Microdose in season, and when else?
