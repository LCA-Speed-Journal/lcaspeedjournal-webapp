# The State of Youth Sports and How to Succeed Today

Three Pillars of Good Programs: Communication, Community, Quality Training
## Single Most Important Goal for Youth Development
Ideally, shouldn’t be one thing, it’s always multifaceted, it should always be about the fluctuation in what’s interesting.
	Obviously looking for physical development (movement literacy), but also mental (growth mindset, taking feedback)
Depends on your population: 
	high-level teams are concerned with development of excellence, but you can’t apply that same ideal to every team and box them in.
	Challenge becomes: what are *all* the important things, and how do we layer them together?
Develop a Utilitarian mindset to tool-acquisition: look for what can check multiple boxes at once, spreading yourself too thin and having something different for everything can be a trap.
## Permission to Coach
It’s an unwritten contract with the athletes: you can’t just exert your will on an unreceptive or unwilling party. 
## Communicate Consistently
- **Set Tone Up Front:** what’s the plan for the day, what are the expectations?
- **Touch Base During:** how are things going?
- **Sum Again @ End:** what are the takeaways? How did the athletes feel about the session?
- **Preview Forward:** what’s on the short/long-term horizon?
