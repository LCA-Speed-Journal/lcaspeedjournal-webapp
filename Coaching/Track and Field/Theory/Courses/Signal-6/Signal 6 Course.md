# Introduction
## Robbing the Cookie Jar
George Goodhart and Alan Beardhall — founders of Applied Kinesiology
- Both were looking at a non-invasive approach to look at the body as an interconnected whole
	- Neurovascular Points, Neurolymphatic, Emotional, Nutritional Components, etc
- A large percentage of the “new approaches” use components from those two individuals, without crediting them — Shawn wanted to take a moment to publicly recognize their influence on Square1 and Signal 6
## Impetus Moment
- Shawn was an [[MAT Rehab]] student at first — MAT concept stemmed from agonist/agonist-group not being able to contract properly
	- Restrictions, perceive as evidence of muscle guarding, then figure which muscle/divisions are inhibited, then activate those agonists
## Brain Maps
Four Hardwired Phases: Sit, Stand, R Step, L Step — Up, Down, Right Left
- Get Up, Get Down — Go Left, Go Right
- 98 Actions attached to Gait
- 8 Axial Actions attached to Get Up / Down
## Square1 and the Birth of Signal 6º
- Square1 is accurately pinpointing the joint-actions that are intolerant, and increasing neural drive to the tissues that create that action
- Signal 6 is a quicker, broader approach, designed for team-sport coaches — not practical to do a Square1 intervention with all athletes on the team
	- Trying to get most of the goodies from full system, use it as part of warmup/cooldown, etc.
# Nuts and Bolts
## What’s the Goal
Goal should always be to consistently and efficiently produce excellent outcomes that last, within the human movement system.
Want the course to expand beyond an extrenal view, and move into an interval view of the body
- How do things actually function, parts work together
- Harder to understand, not as visible, but the “how” of things is just as poetic
## HMS Components
If we want to fix movement for our clients, need to know “how the machine is supposed to work”
- Structural — Articular, Nervous (brain and CNS), and Muscular
- Functional — Organizational and Behavioral
	- Organizational — Motor Control, how brain/body is self-organized
## HMS Outcomes
Outcomes are all the expressions of the HMS (human movement system)
![[Chapter 3 — The Human Movement System]]
## Optimal Movement Triad
Need to optimize, not just settle for improving the system
- Optimal Outcomes are supported by Organization, Behavior, and Structure
	- Structural — MD’s, Surgeons, Chiros, Massage Therapists, PT’s, etc.
	- Organizational — Can also be PT’s and OT’s, as well as Chiros, but also Trainers, Yoga Coaches, etc.
	- Behavioral —  
## Behavior and Organization
Equating Behavior to Motor Learning and Pattern-Rehearsal
- Motor Learning
	- Not wired with physical skills, we learn and earn them through practicing/rehearsing
Equating Organization to Generating Patterns
- Motor-Control is subconscious, prewired and innate maps (Up, Down, Right, Left)
- Optimal Control
	- GRF’s are safe, for every joint action, with tolerance to load, and no compensation
- Control Impairment
	GRF’s are unsafe, for at least one joint-action, without load tolerance, and neural compensation
## Anatomy
- Axial Skeleton — Skull, Jaw, and Spine (Cervical, Thoracic+Ribs, Lumbar, Sacral, Coccyx)
- Appendicular — Scaps down to Fingers, and Pelvis down to Feet
## Planes and Actions
Plane — Any 3 points connected, creating a surface
Cardinal Planes
- Saggital — Divides body into L/R (looking from side), covers flexion/extension
- Transverse — Divides body into top/bottom (looking from above), covers rotation
- Frontal — Divides body into front/back (looking from the front), covers side-bend and ab/adduct
# Signal 6 System
Six in Signal 6º is talking about the “six degrees of freedom” of the body.
	Pronation and Supination, in all 3 Planes of Movement
- Flexion/Extension (Sagittal Pronation/Supination)
- Abduction/Adduction or R/L Side-Bend (Frontal Pronation/Supination)
- IR/ER or R/L Rotation (Transverse Pronation/Supination)
## Motor Control Restoration
Three different options to improve mototr control
- Full Body ISO Routine
	- Visit/Access all joint-actions of the body through ISO-Activation
	- …that’s a lot of work to just address what is potentially just one joint-dysfunction
- Signal 6º
	- Six most Common Areas (30 grouped Joint-Actions) where dysfunction generally occurs
	- T-Spine, Lumbar Spine, Hips, and Knees 
- Square1
	- Most detailed, yes, but hard to multiply across an entire team doing 1:1 with each athlete
	- The “sniper-rifle” to pinpoint which joint-action is driving the compensation of an athlete
## Comprehensive ISOs
- A million ways to go about this, Shawn likes to pair things together
	- Clench Fingers/Toes — Extend Fingers/Toes
	- Flex Ankles/Wrists — Extend Ankles/Wrists
	- (Bend Knees) IR Feet, IR Forearms — ER Feet, ER Forearms
	- Eversion and Radial Deviation — Inversion and Ulnar Deviations
	- Extend Knees, Extend Elbows — Flex Knees, Flex Elbows
	- IR Hips, IR Forearms — ER Hips, ER Forearms
	- Extend Hips, Extend Shoulders — Flex Hips, Flex Shoulders
	- Adduct Hips (Squeeze Knees), Abduct Arms (cross) — Abduct Hips (open wide), Adduct Arms (spread to sides)
	- Shrug Shoulders — Drop Shoulders
	- Protract Shoulders — Retract Shoulders
	- Squeeze Elbows to Sides — Arms Abduct to Ears
	- Turn Head to L/R 
	- Lift Head Up — Press Head Down
	- Tilt Head to L/R (bend neck)
	- Chin to Throat — Chin to Sky
	- Tilt Head (Neck Straight) to (L/R)
	- Jaw to L/R — Jaw Open/Closed
	- Eyes to L/R — Eyes Up/Down
	- Big Chest — Baby Crunch
	- Lean T-Spine L/R
	- Hip Hike (L Leg Long, R Leg Long)
	- Arch Low-Back — Flatten Low-Back
	- Pop L/R Hip to Ceiling
	- Anterior Tilt (knees at 90deg, but on ground) — Posterior Tilt

## Signal 6 Characteristics
- Wanted it to be easy to implement with teams of athletes
	- Nothing really compares to Square1 with respect to specificity, but is a 1:1 situation
- Signal 6 designed to integrate with a warmup, a cooldown, between sets, etc.
- Still needed to be effective, because Square1 has had such mind-blowing results
	- Didn’t want to put out a vastly inferior solution
	- Still not as targeted, but targets the areas where 75% of dysfunctions exist
- Needed to be quick and easy to learn
## Triggering the Nervous System
Easily overlooked aspect of Signal 6 is what is done in between rounds
- If not going immediately to next round, want to introduce some kind of low-level stress
	- Because we aren’t assessing, can’t determine what’s going to be specific stressors
	- Using common stressors, trying to paint broad brush-strokes
	- Starting with Breathing — reliable trigger to touch ribs and inhale/exhale thru mouth
		- Laying in a circle, everyone touching a partner’s ribs while everyone breathes
	- Second Trigger — Bodyweight Squat
	- Third Trigger — Recall Past Injuries
	- Other Things — Rigors of doing a workout (normal exercises, doing in-between sets)
		- After catching breath, do a round of Signal 6
## A Signal 6 Demo
Tip: get some before/after snapshots
- Grip Dynamometer, Tap-Testing, ROM Assessment (straight-leg IR, etc.)
### Sequence
- Knee Ext + Hip Abduct + Lumbar/Thoracic Flex
	- Legs Spread, Flex Quads, Baby Crunch while protruding Chin
- Knee Ext + Hip Adduct + Lumbar/Thoracic Extens
- R Thoracic and Lumbar Sidebend — Hip-Hike + C-Shaped Spine
- Hip Extension — Bridge
- (in Hip Extension) L Pelvic Rotation, R ER, L IR — Twist Pelvis to either side within Bridge
- (in Hip Extension) Hip ER, Abduction — Spread Knees apart within Bridge
- Hip Flexion, Knee Flexion, Lumbar Extension — Knees to Chest, Heels to Butt, Arch Low-Back
	- Can also do Straight-Leg Extension (one knee bent to 90, straight-leg flex the other leg)
	- (In Flex) IR – ER – Neutral – Dorsiflex – Relax – Lock Knee, increase ROM, and repeat
- Tibial IR and ER — Knees Bent at 90º, twist feet internal, then external

# Implementation
### How to Integrate into Sessions
If you’re a 1:1, Sig6 is the beginning of a warmup, can do in between sets (particularly with long rest-periods like heavy lifting), or can do a cooldown with it
If you’re a structured strength-coach, can teach to athletes and have them do it on their own.
- Can partner things together like the straight-leg hip and test-retest within tests to expand ROM
