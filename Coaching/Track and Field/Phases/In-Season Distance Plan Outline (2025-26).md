# In-Season Distance Plan Outline (2025–26)

This outline distills major themes for each phase from your [[Distance Outline (2025-26)]], [[Joe Rubio]] (key-pace, multi-pacing, extended warmups, "distance runner first"), and Jay Johnson (chassis/strength after hard efforts, strides, progression runs, cutting long-run emphasis late season). It assumes your ideal week (M/F track, T/Th weights, W school) and split A/B sessions where they apply.

**Squad profile:** The bulk of your distance athletes are **800 or mile primary**, reaching up to the 3200 when appropriate (e.g. doubling, or when 3200 is useful). You do not have a large group of pure distance / cross-country types who specialize in 3200 and blend down. Phase focuses below are written for that 800/mile-centric group; 3200 is supported for the subset that contests it, not as the default focus.

---

## [[Preseason Phase - Distance|Preseason Phase]] (Weeks 1–2 — Spring Break, 60 min Full-Team)

**Constraint:** Single 60 min block for the whole team; gym-only (no track). Distance shares the same slot as sprinters/jumps/weights.

**Major themes**

- **Identity and volume in 60 minutes:** Use the shared session to maintain "distance runner" habits without separate distance blocks. Per your outline and Rubio's "distance runner first," treat this as continuity of general conditioning, not a pause.
- **Progressive easy running:** Easy running ramps from Week 1 to Week 2 (e.g. 10–15 min on Speed/X-Factor days in Week 1; 15–20 min where possible in Week 2) to bridge toward Preparation Phase volume. No assigned weekend long run in Preseason; optional weekend run only if desired.
- **Warmups:** Simple only (easy run + strides). Full Rubio extended warmups (Warmup A/B, Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn) begin in **Preparation Phase**.
- **Where distance shows up:**  
- **Speed days (M/F):** Integrate with team warmup/priming; add easy running where the 60 min structure allows. No formal "workout" yet—focus on easy/moderate volume and leg turnover.  
- **Weights days (T/Th):** Strength work only during the 60 min session (Johnson: "strengthen the chassis"); no scheduled running in-session. Optional independent easy running for veterans only, outside the session.  
- **X-Factor/Wednesday:** Optional 800m run; 800m TT in the Combine (Week 1) as baseline/rust-buster, not a fitness test.
- **Strides and "rev the engine" (Johnson):** On days with any running, add 4–6 short strides (e.g. 2 @ 5k, 2 @ 3k, 1–2 @ mile/800 feel). Fits within 60 min if kept brief.
- **No key-pace workouts yet:** No Rubio-style primary workout or ±2 pacing in this phase. Preseason = re-establish routine, volume, and compliance under the 60 min cap.

**Deliverables to define later:** Exact duration of "easy add-ons" per day (e.g. max 15–20 min running on Speed/X-Factor days, 10–15 min on Weights days), and how Combine 800m TT is used (baseline only vs. pacing anchor for Prep).

## [[Preparation Phase Distance|Preparation Phase]] (Weeks 3–5 — 3 Weeks, Split A/B, First Meet W5 D3)

**Constraint:** A-Session (3:45–4:45) and B-Session (5:00–6:00); first meet in Week 5, Day 3 (e.g. Gryphon 1). Track days M/F. **Weekly volume target:** 25–30 mi for majority (800/1600 blend) by end of phase.

**Major themes**

- **Extended warmups on track days (Rubio-aligned):** Use **Warmup A** when main work is 400/800/mile-oriented; **Warmup B** when main work is 5k/tempo-oriented. A-Session = progressive run + Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn (or strides on grass when not on track) funneling toward workout pace. See [[Joe Rubio#Extended Warmups]].
- **Key-pace and multi-pacing (Rubio):** Key-pace for Prep block is 1500/mile; over each 2-week microcycle hit that key-pace plus ±2 paces (tempo/5k and 800). One **primary workout per week** (the day that "makes them a bit nervous"); other sessions maintain adjacent qualities.
- **Progressive easy running:** B-Session easy runs on weights days (and optional B-Session on X-Factor for veterans) progress week-over-week so majority approach 25–30 mi/week. Week 3 starts moderate; build by ~3–5 min every 1–2 weeks.
- **Assigned weekend long run:** 4–6 mi (or 35–50 min), introduced Week 3 or 4. Primary tool to build weekly volume. For athletes who trend toward 1600 specialist, 1600/3200, or 3200 specialist: **+1 mi** on the long run only.
- **Leverage split sessions by day type:**  
- **Speed/X-Factor at school (e.g. W):** A-Session = blend of speed/power with distance where it fits; B-Session = optional extra easy mileage for veterans (capped ~30 min) to support "spread volume."  
- **Weights (T/Th):** A-Session = weights; B-Session = easy run after the lift (progressive build).  
- **Track (M/F):** A-Session = extended warmup (Rubio Warmup A/B, Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn); B-Session = primary or secondary distance workout, or lactic work (Kosmin 800/1500–mile, etc.) as in [[Preparation Phase Distance]].
- **Mile (and 800) priority in design:** Bias secondary work and tests toward mile and 800. For the few who reach up to 3200, support comes from 3k/tempo touches and **+1 mi on the long run**, not from programming the whole group around 3200.
- **Johnson:** Ancillary/General Strength immediately after the primary track workout (5–10 min circuit or mobility post-cooldown).

**Deliverables to define later:** Which week gets the "primary" track workout (e.g. Wed vs. Fri in a given week), exact key-pace for Prep (3k vs. 1500/mile), and how Kosmin 800 vs. Kosmin 1500/mile are spaced across the 3 weeks and relative to the first meet.

## [[Competition Phase Distance|Competition Phase]] (Weeks 6–9 — 4 Weeks, ~1 Meet/Week, Split A/B)

**Constraint:** Split A/B continues; average of one competition per week. **Weekly volume target:** Maintain 25–30 mi/week for majority (800/1600 blend) via B-session easy runs + assigned weekend long run.

**Major themes**

- **Primary pace = 1500/mile (Rubio):** Key-pace for the block is mile (secondaries: 3k and 800). Multi-pacing over 14 days: hit mile, 3k, 5k/tempo, and 800 so the full ±2 spread is covered. One primary workout per week; other run days maintain adjacent paces or easy/volume.
- **Competition as a load:** Treat the weekly meet as one of the weekly "hard" stimuli. Avoid stacking primary workout and race in the same 2–3 days; schedule the primary session away from race day (e.g. if you race Wed, primary workout Mon or Fri; if you race Fri/Sat, primary Tue or early Wed).
- **Spread volume + assigned weekend long run:**  
- **Weights days:** Keep B-Session easy running after the lift to support 25–30 mi/week.  
- **Speed/X-Factor at school:** Keep the option for B-Session easy mileage (veterans, ≤30 min).  
- **Track days:** Extended warmup in A-Session (Rubio Warmup A/B); in B-Session alternate between (a) primary/secondary distance workouts, (b) lactic work with distance progressions, and (c) race-specific tune-ups or race simulation, depending on where the meet falls.  
- **Assigned weekend long run:** 4–6 mi for most of the season; **peak 6–9 mi** for athletes who can handle it. **Assigned** (not optional) to support 25–30 mi/week. For athletes who trend toward 1600 specialist, 1600/3200, or 3200 specialist: **+1 mi** on the long run only. On heavy meet or taper weeks, per Johnson: shorten the long run or **substitute a progression run** (e.g. 10 min steady, 5 min faster, 5 min controlled) to manage cumulative stress.
- **Extended warmups (Rubio):** Continue **Warmup A** when main work is 400/800/mile-oriented; **Warmup B** when it's 5k/tempo-oriented. Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn as bridge into mile/800 work. See [[Joe Rubio#Extended Warmups]].
- **Chassis and recovery (Johnson):** Keep short General Strength / mobility immediately after the primary workout; on meet weeks, optional light ancillary the day after the race instead of doubling down on intensity.

**Deliverables to define later:** Week-by-week assignment of "primary" vs "secondary" vs "race" for each track day; progression-run format and decision rules for when to substitute a progression run for the assigned long run (e.g. back-to-back meets, illness, or high academic load).

## Championship Phase (Weeks 10–12 to Sectionals, Then +2 Weeks to State If Advancing)

**Constraint:** Final 3 weeks to sectional competition; if athletes advance, 2 more weeks to state. Goal: sharpen for **mile and 800** (your primary cohort); for the subset contesting 3200, support them with targeted 3k/tempo touches and race prep without shifting the overall 800/mile focus.

**Major themes**

- **Mile and 800 as the peak targets:** Key-pace and race-preparation logic centers on 1600 and 800. Multi-pacing remains: keep touching 3k and 800 (and optionally tempo) within the 14-day cycle so athletes don't lose range, but the "nervous" workout and race simulations are mile- and 800-focused. For anyone racing 3200 at sectionals/state, add just enough 3k/tempo or pacing work to support that reach—e.g. one controlled 3k effort or a 3200 race-plan session—without making 3200 the phase center.
- **Taper and density:** Reduce density (fewer hard days per week or shorter primary workout) in the last 7–10 days before sectionals. Do not add new volume or new intensity; preserve one crisp mile-paced session and one controlled 800/mile tune-up. For those using a long run, per Johnson: shorten or replace with a 20–25 min progression to manage fatigue.
- **Extended warmups and race readiness:** Use Rubio's Warmup A (or your track version) consistently before mile/800 work so the run-up to sectionals and state feels familiar. Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn can be part of that routine as a bridge into race-pace efforts.
- **Sectionals → State (if applicable):** The extra 2 weeks are "hold fitness, stay sharp": one primary mile/800-oriented session per week, easy/maintenance otherwise, strides frequently. No new training stimulus; emphasis on recovery, nutrition, and psychology. For 3200 qualifiers, an optional low-key 3k or 3200-pace effort if it fits the calendar and doesn't add stress.
- **Chassis to the end (Johnson):** Maintain a minimal General Strength / mobility routine (e.g. 2×/week, short) through sectionals and state to support resilience and avoid "everything drops at once" when intensity backs off.

**Deliverables to define later:** Exact taper lengths (e.g. 10 days vs. 7 days before sectionals); template for "one primary + one tune-up" in the last 2 weeks before sectionals; and a simple 2-week state-meet template (e.g. one primary session in W1, one light tune-up in W2, then race).

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes (Rubio + Johnson)

- **Rubio:** Key-pace and ±2 pacing over 14 days; one primary workout per week; extended warmups that funnel into workout pace; "distance runner first" (conditioning/capacity before loading anaerobic capacity); avoid raising mileage and intensity in the same step—in season, hold or gently raise volume in Prep/early Competition, then hold volume and refine intensity into Championship.  
- **Johnson:** "Rev the engine" most days (easy + strides); "strengthen the chassis" with lifting and ancillary work; do strength/GS immediately after hard running when possible; use progression runs and shortened long runs late season to manage cumulative stress while keeping aerobic quality.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Preseason:** Progressive easy-add-on durations (W1: 10–15 min; W2: 15–20 min) and Combine 800m TT role (baseline only vs. pacing input for Prep) are set; Rubio extended warmups begin in Preparation.  
2. **Preparation:** Key-pace 1500/mile; primary-workout day each week; Kosmin scheduling vs. first meet; assigned weekend long run 4–6 mi introduced; volume target 25–30 mi by end of phase; +1 mi long run for 3200 reach.  
3. **Competition:** Build a 4-week grid: primary vs. secondary vs. race; assigned long run 4–6 mi (peak 6–9); decision rules for when to substitute progression run for long run.  
4. **Championship:** Define taper length and a 2-week state-meet template.

All of this can live as theme-level bullets in [[Distance Outline (2025-26)]] or in separate phase notes that link back to the outline and to [[Joe Rubio]] (and, if you add a note, Jay Johnson).
