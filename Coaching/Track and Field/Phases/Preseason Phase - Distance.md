# Preseason Phase — Distance (2025-26)

*Weeks 1–2 — Spring Break, 60 min Full-Team Sessions*

This plan outlines the Preseason Phase training for in-season distance athletes, integrating with the existing 60-minute full-team gym sessions. The approach follows guidelines from [[In-Season Distance Plan Outline (2025-26)]], drawing on principles from [[Joe Rubio]] ("distance runner first," key-pace progression) and Jay Johnson ("rev the engine" with strides, "strengthen the chassis" with strength work).

**Squad profile:** The bulk of distance athletes are **800 or mile primary**, reaching up to the 3200 when appropriate. This plan is written for that 800/mile-centric group.

## High-Level Themes

### Identity and Volume in 60 Minutes
The Preseason Phase uses the shared 60-minute session to maintain "distance runner" habits without separate distance blocks. Per [[Joe Rubio]]'s "distance runner first" principle, treat this as continuity of general conditioning, not a pause. The goal is to re-establish routine, volume, and compliance under the 60-minute constraint.

### Integration Points by Day Type

- **Speed days (M/F):** Integrate with team warmup/priming; add easy running or a short aerobic block where the 60-minute structure allows (e.g., after main work or in place of a portion of accessories). No formal "workout" yet—focus on easy/moderate volume and leg turnover.
- **Weights days (T/Th):** Focus on strength work only during the 60-minute session. Time is well-budgeted for weights, and newer/weaker athletes especially need the strength work more than running volume at this stage. **No scheduled running during the session.** Optional independent easy running for veterans only (outside the 60-minute session).
- **X-Factor/Wednesday:** Optional 800m run; 800m TT in the Combine (Week 1) as baseline/rust-buster, not a fitness test. Easy running and strides where time allows.

### Warmups: Simple in Preseason; Rubio Extended Warmups Begin in Preparation

Preseason uses **simple warmups only**: easy run + strides. No progressive run, no Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn, no pace-specific strides. Full [[Joe Rubio]] extended warmup protocol (Warmup A/B, Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn, progressive run) begins in the **Preparation Phase** so athletes progress into that structure gradually.

### Strides and "Rev the Engine" (Johnson)

On days with any running (Speed/X-Factor days), add 4–6 short strides to keep leg speed and coordination for the 800/mile-centric group:
- 2 strides @ 5k feel
- 2 strides @ 3k feel  
- 1–2 strides @ mile/800 feel

Strides fit within the 60-minute window if kept brief (e.g., 50–100m strides with walk-back recovery). This maintains leg speed and coordination without adding significant volume.

### No Key-Pace Workouts Yet

No [[Joe Rubio]]-style primary workout or ±2 pacing in this phase. Preseason = re-establish routine, volume, and compliance under the 60-minute cap. Focus on easy/moderate volume and leg turnover, not structured pace work.

### 800m Time Trial Role

The 800m TT in Week 1's Combine serves as a baseline/rust-buster, not a fitness test. It provides an early-season marker and can inform pacing decisions for the Preparation Phase, but the primary purpose is to re-establish the routine of racing and provide a controlled effort after the offseason.

## Week 1 — Spring Break A

*5 Days, all Constrained to the Gym — Aiming for 60min Sessions with Full-Team*

Running the Track & Field Combine on Wednesday (Jumps-Testing) and Friday (Speed-Trials), so expect bigger attendance on those days.

### Monday — Speed A (Short Accels)

**Integration with Team Session:**
- Participate in team warmup/priming (10–15 min)
- Distance athletes join the group warmup and CNS priming activities
- After team's main work (sleds/accels), distance adds their running component

**Distance-Specific Work (Week 1 — 10–15 min easy):**
- **Easy running:** 10–15 minutes of easy, conversational pace
  - Can be done in the gym (if space allows) or immediately outside
  - Focus on maintaining aerobic base and leg turnover
  - No structured pace—just easy, controlled running
- **Strides (4–6 total):**
  - 2 strides @ 5k feel (50–100m, walk-back recovery)
  - 2 strides @ 3k feel (50–100m, walk-back recovery)
  - 1–2 strides @ mile/800 feel (50–100m, walk-back recovery)
  - Keep strides brief to fit within time constraint

**Total Time:** ~25–30 minutes (warmup/priming) + 10–15 min (easy run) + 5–8 min (strides) = fits within 60-minute window

### Tuesday — Weights A (Intro and Statics)

**Integration with Team Session:**
- Distance athletes participate fully in weights session
- Focus on strength work: ISO-Test (Ankle Dorsiflexion), Statics (Upper-Push, Upper-Pull, Lower-Push, Lower-Pull, Core, Lower-Leg)
- Time is well-budgeted for strength work; newer/weaker athletes especially need this

**Distance-Specific Work:**
- **No scheduled running during the 60-minute session**
- **Optional independent work for veterans only:** If veterans want additional easy running, they can do so independently outside the session (e.g., 10–15 min easy run on their own time)
- Emphasis: "Strengthen the chassis" (Johnson) via lifting; newer athletes need strength more than running volume at this stage

### Wednesday — X-Factor (Jumps / Plyos + Combine)

**Integration with Team Session:**
- Participate in team warmup/priming
- **800m Time Trial** as part of Track & Field Combine (Jumps-Testing day)
  - Baseline/rust-buster effort, not a fitness test
  - Provides early-season marker and can inform Prep Phase pacing
  - Run at controlled effort—aim for ~85–90% of current fitness, not all-out

**Distance-Specific Work (if time allows after 800m TT):**
- **Optional easy running:** 5–10 minutes easy, conversational pace (if athlete feels recovered and time permits)
- **Strides (4–6 total):**
  - 2 strides @ 5k feel
  - 2 strides @ 3k feel
  - 1–2 strides @ mile/800 feel
  - Can be done post-800m TT if athlete is recovered

**Note:** The 800m TT is the primary distance work for this day; additional running is optional and should not interfere with recovery from the TT.

### Thursday — Weights B (Dynamic-Day)

**Integration with Team Session:**
- Distance athletes participate fully in weights session
- Focus on strength work: ISO-Test (Adduction), Dynamic work (Upper Push, Performance Cycling, Core, Lower-Leg)
- Time is well-budgeted for strength work

**Distance-Specific Work:**
- **No scheduled running during the 60-minute session**
- **Optional independent work for veterans only:** If veterans want additional easy running, they can do so independently outside the session (e.g., 10–15 min easy run on their own time)
- Emphasis: Strength work takes priority; newer athletes need strength more than running volume

### Friday — Speed B (Speed Trials)

**Integration with Team Session:**
- Participate in team warmup/priming (10–15 min)
- Distance athletes join the group warmup and CNS priming activities
- Team's main work: Speed Trials (CMJ, MB OH Throw, 30m Dash)
- After team's main work, distance adds their running component

### Progressive Build in Easy Running

Easy running **ramps from Week 1 to Week 2** to bridge toward Preparation Phase volume:
- **Week 1:** 10–15 min easy on Speed/X-Factor days
- **Week 2:** 15–20 min easy on Speed/X-Factor days (where the 60 min structure allows)

### Weekly Volume Structure

**Speed Days (M/F):** Progressive easy running + 4–6 strides
- **Week 1:** 10–15 min easy = ~2.5–3.5 miles easy + strides
- **Week 2:** 15–20 min easy = ~3–4 miles easy + strides

**X-Factor Day (W):**
- **Week 1:** 800m TT (primary work) + optional 5–10 min easy + strides
- **Week 2:** Optional 800m run or 10–15 min easy + strides

**Weights Days (T/Th):**
- **No scheduled running during 60-minute session**
- **Optional independent work for veterans only:** 10–15 min easy run outside session (adds ~1.5–2 miles if done)

### Weekend Running

**Optional but Recommended.** A long run isn’t formally assigned in Preseason, but is recommended (particularly for athletes with higher training age.)
If athletes want additional easy running on the weekend, recommend the following at a pace just faster than easy (a confident run, but not a struggle — “a strong effort within oneself” is how Rubio describes it):
- **Novices:** 3-4mi
- **Baseline**/Intermediates: 5-6mi
- **Veterans:** 7-8mi
The assigned weekend long run begins in the Preparation Phase.

### Total Weekly Volume Estimates

- **Base volume (Speed/X-Factor days only):** ~5–8 miles/week (Week 1: ~5–7; Week 2: ~6–8 with progressive build)
- **With optional veteran independent work (2x weights days):** ~8–11 miles/week

**Note:** Progressive build in Week 2 prepares athletes for the volume increase in the Preparation Phase when split A/B sessions and the assigned weekend long run begin.

## Integration Notes

### Team Warmup/Priming on Speed Days

Distance athletes participate fully in the team warmup and CNS priming activities. This includes:
- Mobility work (Dynamic Hip Sequence, Foot/Ankle mobility, T-Spine mobility)
- ISO-Holds (SL-Stand, ISO-Lunge, fRoller Bridge)
- Dynamic warmup (thermodynamic activities, dynamic stretches, backwards series)
- CNS priming drills (A-Series, Pogos, Toe-Pops, etc.)

This integration maintains team cohesion and ensures distance athletes are properly warmed up before adding their running component.

### Weights Days: Strength Priority

The 60-minute weights sessions are well-budgeted for strength work. Newer/weaker athletes especially need this foundational strength work more than running volume at this stage. Distance athletes should focus fully on the weights session during the 60-minute block.

**Optional independent work for veterans:** If veteran athletes (those with 2+ years of training) want additional easy running, they can do so independently after the weights session concludes. This should be:
- **Duration:** 10–20 minutes easy running
- **Intensity:** Easy, conversational pace
- **Location:** Outside (e.g., on the roads, up at the park, etc)
- **Frequency:** Optional, but recommended for vets—for newbies, only if athlete feels they need additional volume

### 800m Time-Trial Integration (Week 1)

The 800m TT on Wednesday of Week 1 is part of the Track & Field Combine (Jumps-Testing day). It serves as:
- **Middle-School Evaluation:** for the middle-school tryout-group, the 800m TT *is* a test, to see if they meet minimum standards to join the varsity team in the distance group
- **Varsity Baseline/rust-buster:** Not a fitness test, but a controlled effort to re-establish racing routine
- **Early-season marker:** Provides data point for current fitness
- **Potential pacing anchor:** May inform pacing decisions for Preparation Phase workouts, but this is secondary to its role as a baseline

Varsity athletes should run at ~85–90% of current fitness, not all-out. The goal is to get back into the routine of racing, not to test maximum fitness.

### Coordination with Sprints/Jumps Schedule

The distance plan integrates seamlessly with the sprints/jumps schedule:
- **Speed days:** Distance adds running after team's main work, fitting within the 60-minute window
- **Weights days:** Distance participates fully in weights; no running during session
- **X-Factor days:** Distance adds optional running/800m work alongside team's jump testing

This coordination ensures efficient use of the shared 60-minute block while maintaining each group's training priorities.

## Key Principles Summary

### From [[Joe Rubio]]

- **"Distance runner first":** Maintain conditioning/capacity during Preseason. This phase is continuity of general conditioning, not a pause.
- **Easy on rigidity of key-pace workouts:** Preseason = re-establish routine, volume, and compliance. Structured pace work begins in Preparation Phase.
- **Avoid raising mileage and intensity in the same step:** In Preseason, focus on easy/moderate volume and leg turnover. Intensity will come later.

### From Jay Johnson

- **"Rev the engine":** Use easy running + strides on Speed/X-Factor days to maintain leg speed and coordination.
- **"Strengthen the chassis":** Weights days prioritize strength work, especially critical for newer/weaker athletes. Running volume can wait.
- **Strides progression:** 4–6 strides per running day, progressing from 5k feel → 3k feel → mile/800 feel.

### Preseason-Specific Priorities

1. **Re-establish routine:** Get athletes back into the habit of consistent training
2. **Maintain identity:** Keep "distance runner first" mindset active
3. **Build strength foundation:** Weights days are critical for newer athletes
4. **Maintain leg speed:** Strides on running days keep coordination sharp
5. **Set baseline:** 800m TT provides early-season marker

## Transition to Preparation Phase

At the end of Week 2, athletes should have:
- Re-established training routine and compliance
- Maintained basic aerobic base through easy running on Speed/X-Factor days
- Built foundational strength through weights sessions
- Maintained leg speed through strides
- Completed baseline 800m TT (Week 1)

The Preparation Phase (Weeks 3–5) will introduce:
- Split A/B sessions (more time for distance-specific work)
- **Full Rubio extended warmups** on track days (Warmup A/B, Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn, progressive run)
- Key-pace and multi-pacing workouts ([[Joe Rubio]] model)
- **Assigned weekend long run** (4–6 mi) for volume build
- First meet in Week 5, Day 3

See [[In-Season Distance Plan Outline (2025-26)]] for details on the Preparation Phase structure.
