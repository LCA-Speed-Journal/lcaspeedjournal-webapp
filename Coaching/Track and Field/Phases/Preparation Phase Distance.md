# Preparation Phase Distance Plan (Weeks 3-5)

## Overview
**Duration:** 3 weeks (Weeks 3-5)  
**Structure:** Split A/B sessions (A: 3:45-4:45, B: 5:00-6:00)  
**First Meet:** Week 5, Day 3 (Wednesday - Gryphon 1)  
**Key-Pace:** 1500/mile (primary), with ±2 pacing (3k, 5k/tempo, 800)  
**Weekly volume target:** 25-30 mi/week for majority (800/1600 blend) by end of phase, via progressive easy running + assigned weekend long run.

**Track Availability Constraints:**
- **Week 3:** Track available Friday only; Monday workouts at school (grass field, 500m asphalt loop, or road)
- **Week 4:** Track available Monday; No practice Friday (no school)
- **Week 5:** Track available Monday and Friday
- **Non-track surfaces:** Grass field, 500m asphalt loop around park, or road running

## Weekly Structure Overview

---

## Key Principles
- **Extended warmups on track days (M/F):** Aligned with [[Joe Rubio#Extended Warmups]]. Use **Warmup A** when main work is 400/800/mile-oriented; use **Warmup B** when main work is 5k/tempo-oriented. A-Session = progressive run + Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn (or strides on grass when not on track) funneling toward workout pace.
  - **Baseline (0-1.5 years experience):** 10-15 min progressive run + 4-6 strides + pace-specific strides
  - **Veterans (opt-up):** Full extended warmup protocol (20 min progressive run + Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn + pace-specific strides)
- **Multi-pacing over 14 days:** Hit 1500/mile (key), 3k, 5k/tempo, and 800 within each 2-week microcycle
- **One primary workout per week:** Friday track session (or Monday when no Friday practice) — the session that makes athletes "a bit nervous"
- **Spread volume:** B-Session easy running on weights days (T/Th) — **progressive week-over-week build** so majority approach 25-30 mi/week by end of phase
- **Assigned weekend long run:** 4-6 mi (or time-based, 35-50 min), introduced Week 3 or 4; primary tool to build weekly volume (see Weekend Long Run below)
- **Mile/800 priority:** Even with 1500/mile as key-pace, bias secondary work toward mile and 800 support
- **Chassis after hard efforts:** General Strength/ancillary work immediately after primary track workout (5-10 min circuit or mobility)
- **Volume philosophy:** Easy run durations progress week-over-week. Target 25-30 mi/week for 800/1600 athletes; longer-event athletes (1600/3200, 3200 specialist) add +1 mi to long run only.

---

## Extended Warmup Protocol (Track Days - M/F)

Aligned with [[Joe Rubio#Extended Warmups]]. Use **Warmup A** when the main workout is 400/800/mile-oriented (e.g., mile-paced reps, Kosmin test, 800-paced work). Use **Warmup B** when the main workout is 5k/tempo-oriented (e.g., 5k-paced repeats, fartlek, tempo). Structure below follows **Warmup A** (mile/800-focused):

### Baseline (0-1.5 years experience, minimal offseason)
1. **10-15 min progressive run**
   - 5-8 min easy (conversational pace)
   - 3-5 min at aerobic threshold (slightly slower than marathon pace)
   - 2-3 min at tempo (10k race pace)

2. **4-6 strides on grass/track**
   - 2 @ 3k feel, 2 @ mile feel, 2 @ 800m feel
   - 80-100m each

3. **Pace-specific strides**
   - 1 x 150m @ 1500 pace
   - 1 x 150m @ 800 pace

4. **Recovery**
   - 3-5 min easy jog/walk before proceeding to main workout

### Veterans (Opt-up - cross-country experience, consistent offseason)
1. **20 min progressive run**
   - 10 min easy (conversational pace)
   - 5 min at aerobic threshold (slightly slower than marathon pace)
   - 5 min at tempo (10k race pace)

2. **1200-1600m Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn**
   - Continuous effort: stride the straightaway, jog the turn
   - Pacing progression: 2 @ 3k feel, 2 @ mile feel, 2 @ 800m feel
   - See [[Joe Rubio#Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn]]

3. **Pace-specific strides**
   - 1 x 150-200m @ 1500 pace
   - 1 x 150-200m @ 800 pace
   - 1 x 150m acceleration (1500/800/400 progression)

4. **Final activation (Friday primary workouts)**
   - 1 x 150m Sprint/Float/Sprint (400/800/400 feel)

5. **Recovery**
   - 5-10 min easy jog/walk before proceeding to main workout

---

## Weekend Long Run (Assigned)

- **Role:** Primary tool to build weekly volume; no AM running in this plan, so the long run is a larger share of total mileage. Aim for ~15-25% of weekly volume (e.g., 4-5 mi at 25 mi/week).
- **Introduction:** Start in **Week 3**.
- **Progression:**
  - **Week 3:** 4 mi on low-end (novices), 7 on high end (veterans) or 35-40 min easy (if introduced this week)
  - **Week 4:** (+1mi, or +10mins from prior week)
  - **Week 5:** (+1mi, or +10mins from prior week)
- **Prescription:** **Assigned** weekend run (Saturday or Sunday), not optional. Easy, conversational pace.
- **Event-specific:** For athletes who trend toward 1600 specialist, 1600/3200, or 3200 specialist, add **+1 mi** to the long run (e.g., 5-8 mi instead of 4-7 mi).

## Multi-Pacing Summary (14-Day Microcycle)

Based on [[Joe Rubio#Training Theory]] weekly pacing approach, covering key-pace and ±2 paces (slower and faster) over 14 days:

**Weeks 3-4 (First 2-week cycle):**
- Week 3 Monday: **Key-pace (fartlek)** — KEY-PACE development (aerobic)
- Week 3 Wednesday: **3k pace** (slower than key-pace) — SECONDARY
- Week 3 Friday: **Kosmin test (800m)** — Testing/Assessment (no additional workout)
- Week 4 Monday: **1500/mile pace** (key-pace) — PRIMARY
- Week 4 Wednesday: **5k/tempo pace** (slower than key-pace) — SECONDARY

**Weeks 4-5 (Second 2-week cycle):**
- Week 4 Monday: **1500/mile pace** (key-pace) — PRIMARY
- Week 4 Wednesday: **5k/tempo pace** (slower than key-pace) — SECONDARY
- Week 4 Thursday: **800m pace** (faster than key-pace) — TERTIARY
- Week 5 Monday: **3k pace** (slower than key-pace) — SECONDARY
- Week 5 Friday: **800m pace** (faster than key-pace) — PRIMARY (with 400-pace work with sprinters, then 800-pace finisher)

**Result:** Over any 14-day period, athletes hit 1500/mile (key-pace), 3k/5k/tempo (slower than key-pace), and 800/400 (faster than key-pace) — full spread around key-pace.

## Integration with Sprints/Jumps Schedule

See [[Preparation Phase]] for full team schedule. Distance integration:

- **Track Days (M/F):** Distance uses A-Session for extended warmup, then joins full team in B-Session for track work (distance-specific workout while sprints/jumps do their work)
- **Weights Days (T/Th):** Distance does weights in A-Session, easy running in B-Session (adds volume without conflicting with sprints/jumps)
- **X-Factor Days (W):** Distance can blend with sprints/jumps in A-Session, optional easy mileage in B-Session for veterans
- **Lactic Days (F):** Distance primary workout happens in B-Session; sprints/jumps do their lactic work (24/28s drill, 3x200m, etc.) simultaneously

---

## B-Session Activities by Day Type

### Track Days (M/F when available)
- **A-Session:** Extended warmup (see Extended Warmup Protocol above)
- **B-Session:** Primary or secondary distance workout
  - Primary: Key-pace work (1500/mile) or +2 pace (800)
  - Secondary: +1 pace (3k) or -1 pace (5k/tempo)
  - Cooldown: 10-20 min easy + strides
  - General Strength: 5-10 min circuit post-cooldown

### Non-Track Days (School - Grass Field, 500m Asphalt Loop, or Road)
- **Available surfaces:**
  - Grass field (measured distances)
  - 500m asphalt loop around park
  - Road running
- **Workout adaptations:**
  - Use 500m loop for precise distance work (e.g., 2 loops = 1000m, 3 loops = 1500m, 6 loops = 3000m)
  - Use grass field for measured distance intervals
  - Extended warmups adapted: replace Stride-the-Straight/Jog-the-Turn with strides on grass field
  - Pacing adjustments: account for surface differences (grass slightly slower, asphalt similar to track)
