# Objectives / Goals
## Mile is the 2026 Priority
We generally do a great job at developing speed, so our 800m ceiling rises, but we have historically struggled in the mile: as such, I want that to be our focus this year.
## Spread out Volume
Did not do as great a job in 2025 with overall distance volume: 
- did a great job at building speed through lactic work alongside sprinters, which boosted speed in our 800m performances. 
- We had targeted workouts on the track, but did not get much volume stimulus on other days during the week. 
- 2x p/wk weights-work boosted efficiency in our 3200m performances through enhanced running economy and ankle stiffness.
## More Frequent Dosing
Similar to above, we had workouts at the track, but lacked additional stimulus throughout the week, which left adaptation on the table. Need to bump this in 2026.
# General Ideas
## Leveraging the Split-Session Practices
Plan to leverage the split A/B-Session practices for distance are as follows:
### A-Session (3:45-4:45)
- On Speed/X-Factor Days at the school: balance speed and power-development alongside the sprinters with distance-specific workouts.
- On Weights Days: perform weights-work to boost general strength and enhance running economy
- On Speed/Lactic Days at the track: see “Extended Warmups on Track Days”
### B-Session (5:00-6:00)
- On Speed/X-Factor Days at the school: if needed, open up an option for more veteran athletes to get additional easy mileage in (shorter additions, nothing beyond 30mins)
- On Weights Days: following the lift in A-Session, go out for some easy running to boost weekly mileage
- On Speed/Lactic Days at the track: balance doing Lactic work alongside sprinters for speed endurance, doing distance-specific workouts, or distance-focused adaptations to Lactic days.
## Extended Warmups on Track-Days (from Prep-Phase onwards)
On track days (2x p/wk, M/F, from 5:00-6:00), use the A-Session time-frame to do some extended warmups at easy-moderate plus some strides. From there, move to the track to finish with some targeted work and open up a larger chunk of time for distance workouts.
## Independent Long-Runs
Open up the idea of doing an independent long-run over the weekend during the season, to maintain support for our 1600/3200 athletes, seeing as most of our weekly work targets the 800/1600 blend.
## Multi-Pacing Model
Drawn from Joe-Rubio, leverage pacing based on the Key-Pace for that mesocycle, balanced across a 2wk microcycle to hit  +/- 2 Paces from the Key-Pace over a 14-day span
# Ideal Week
*This depends on if we have competitions, days off of school, etc. But in an ideal world, this is the split for the team.*
- M — Track-Day, Speed or X-Factor
- T — Weights-Day
- W — at the School, X-Factor or Speed
- Th — Weights-Day
- F — Track-Day, Speed or Lactic
# Workouts — Previous Examples and Current Thoughts
## Pulled from 2025
*Note: these are just workouts from the 2024-25 season list. They aren’t necessarily good, nor bad, just examples.*
### Preseason Phase
- (Easy + Strides/Surges within the total effort)
- Interval Run (40-45mins — 30s on @ Mile, 2:30 off @ Steady)
- 3x400m — pace alternating every 50m between goal-400m and cruise
### Preparation Phase
- (Easy + Strides/Surges within the total effort)
- 2x200m + 2x150m — 200m jog between reps, progressing pace from controlled to near-sprint by last 150
- 4x400m — 200m @ 800 pace, 100m jog, then 100m kick-in to finish at a sprint.
- 2 x (4x400m) — 15% slower than goal-mile; 60s between reps, 3min between sets
- 6x300m with a 200m jog between. Starting at 800m pace, ending at 400m pace.
### Competition Phase
- (Easy + Strides/Surges within the total effort)
- 3 x (5x400m) — 10% slower than goal-mile; 75s between reps, 2min between sets
- Progression Run (40-50min — 7min easy → 8min with 4x20s surges → 10min steady → 5-10min faster → 5min fast but controlled. Finishing with 5-10min easy.)
- Interval Run (40-45mins — 60s on @ Mile, 2min off @ Steady)
- 2x800m — 500m at 800 pace, 100m walk, 200m kick-in to finish at a sprint.
- 8x200m (start at 800m pace, work down to 400m pace by end, with a 200m jog between)
- 800m Priming-Day — as [[Jay Johnson]] (5-10min WU Run → Drills → 3x150m as In-Ease-Out → 2x200 as first 200m of 800m → 2x120 at 800m Race-Cadence)
- 4x300m — 200m at goal-800 pace, 100m kick-in
## Rubio-Style Formats that Seem Reasonable
### Rubio-Style Fartleks
Rubio style fartleks are as the Kenyans do, that the recovery portion is fairly solid (not jogging) with surges off this faster, sustained recovery pace. He frames them best used in the summer and fall when concerned with aerobic development, but a lot of our kids are coming off minimal offseason and might need an aerobic jump-start.
	As for pacing: Rubio claims that the goal is to be able to surge consistently off a 20-50min AE-paced run. As the athletes attains greatere fitness, the “off’s” of the fartlek should begin to increase in pace (from slow-end of aerobic conditioning in the fall, to 75% of 5k by the middle of XC, to 80% of 5k by end of fall. Generally, the on’s won’t change much in pace, generally between 10k and tempo effort in the summer and down to roughly 5k-10k effort in the fall.
Examples of Rubio-Style Fartleks include:
- “Minutes:” 10-25 x 60s on/off.
- “NAU” fartlek: 3-8 x 3min on/off. Done every other week, recovery decreasing 30s each successive time until the athlete gets down to 1min.
- “Wake Forest Drill:” on a gradual uphill slope of approx 800m. Run up at 5k-10k effort, turnaround immediately and run back down at 10-20s slower. Repeat for 3-8 reps, where one rep = up+down.
- (called out for those coming off an injury or extended break) 6-10 x 30s on/90s off, or 4-8 x 1min on/5min off
### Track Aerobic Endurance Phase Workout-Examples (Rubio places January-March)
#### Faster than mile-pace workouts
- Early-Phase: begin both workouts with AE Run of 25-30mins followed by 1200m of stride-the-straight/jog-the-turn (2 @ 3k, 2 @ mile, 2 @ 800)
	- 3-4 x 100m relaxed accelerations (last 10m at best relaxed top-end) with walk-back recoveries. Then 4-6 x 30m with walk-back recovery. Focus on form, turnover. Easy 15-20min cooldown.
	- 800-Focused day: 150’s at 800 effort with easy 250-jog recoveries. Focus on good form and turnover, in spikes if possible. 15-20min cooldown, done every other week.
- Late-Phase: begin both workouts with AE Run of 25-30mins followed by 1200-1600m of stride-the-straight/jog-the-turn (2 @ 3k, 2 @ mile, 2 @ 800)
	- 3-4 x 150m relaxed accelerations (last 10m at best relaxed top-end) with walk-back recoveries. Then 6-8 x 30m with walk-back recovery or 4-6 hard 80-120m steep hill reps.. Focus on form, turnover. Easy 15-20min cooldown.
	- 800-Focused day: 2 x (4x200m at 800 pace) with 100m jog between reps, 400m jog between sets. In spikes if possible. 15-20min cooldown, done every other week.
#### Mile-Pace workouts
- Early-Phase: begin both workouts with AE Run of 25-30min followed by 4-6 light strides (3k, mile, 800)
	- 4 x (4-6 x 200m) or 4 x (2x300m) at mile-effort with 100m jog between each, 400m between sets. 15-20min cooldown.
	- 9-12 x 300m on a gradual uphill concentrating on form, with jog-down recoveries. Done as sets (form, medium, hard) once every other week. 15-20min cooldown.

	- 3 x (4-6 x 400m) with 200m jog between each, 400m jog between sets. 15-20min cooldown.
#### Slower than mile-pace workouts (Saturday-Strength, as Rubio labeled them)
- Early-Phase
	- Controlled marathon type up-tempo run. 25-30min straight into 20-50min starting and ending at tempo. 2-4 x 150-200’s finishes following. Done every other week.
	- 25-30min followed by 4-6 light strides (3k, mile 800). 12–16 x 400m at 5k pace, with 200m jog between. Done every other week.
- Late-Phase: begin workouts with 25-30min followed by 4-6 light strides (3k, mile, 800m)
	- 4-6mi at tempo with 2-4 x 400m as bookends (10k pace). Finish with 2-4 x 150-200’s. Done every other week.
	- 6-8 x 800m at 5k pace with 200m jog between. 3-4 x 150-200m finishes.
### Track Pre-Comp Phase Workout-Examples (Rubio Places March to May)
*Note: adding a new warmup component: Warmup A and Warmup B, as detailed in [[Joe Rubio]].*
Each workout per-category is successive, meaning don’t try the 800’s at mile pace before successfully completing the 400’s, then the 600’s. It’s easy to train beyond abilities and fall into the valley of fatigue.
*Note-2: don’t race the workouts, race the races.*
#### All Out Speed

- 2 x 400-800m at 5k, 3-5mi at tempo, 2 x 400-800m at tempo. All with 200-400m jog between.
- 4 x (4x400m, with first 3 reps at 10k, last rep at 5k). 100m jog between reps, 200m jog between sets.
#### Change of Pace

#### Change of Pace
- 300-200m Descending Ladder: 300m → 280m → 260m → 240m → 220m → 200m. Start the first 300 at mile-pace, make each successive rep faster such that the last rep is at best effort.
## Formats referenced by [[Steve Magness]] that Seem Reasonable
### Aerobic Short-Intervals
Formed by Mihaly Igloi, it adopts an interval-style approach to aerobic development. For example, if you run 100m repeats separated by 50m jogs at 800m pace, you’ll procude less lactic than 200 or 300m repeats. You can do 100m repeats at moderate paces with short rest, and have it be a similar stimulus to running a 5mi threshold run.
#### Aerobic-Development using an Interval-Method
- For an 800m Runner who runs 1:52, or 14s per 100m):
	- 3 x (10x100m) at 16s, 20-25s between reps, 5-6min between sets
	- 3x400m of (60m at 800m pace, 40m easy), 6min rest between sets
	- 2 x (5x150m) at 15s pace, 50m jog (30s) between reps, 5-6min between sets
- For a 5k Runner:
	- Easy run with 30s pickups in the middle
	- 9mi easy with 8x45s surges at 5k-10k pace with 2:15 rest after
	- 8x200m at 3k pace with 200m easy jog between
	- 8x100m, 8x200m with 100’s at mile-pace and 20s rest, 200s at 5k down to 3k with 200m easy
#### Specific Endurance using an Interval-Method
- For an 800m Runner
	- Sets of 8x100m with 45s rest at current 800m pace
	- Sets of 8x100m with 35s rest at *goal* 800m pace
	- Sets of 4x200m with 40s rest at 800m pace
- For a 5k Runner:
	- 200m repeats at goal pace (e.g. 12x200m at 5k with 200m jog), progressing to sets of 400s (4 x 4x400m at 5k with 45s rep-rest, 4min set-rest) and onward.
