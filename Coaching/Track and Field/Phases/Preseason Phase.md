# Outlining 
*Following, roughly, a [[High-Low Model]]*
- 3x p/wk: High-Intensity
	- Sprints, Jumps
- 2x p/wk: Low-Intensity
	- Weights-Days (see [[Portable Weight-Room]])
## General Weekly Structure
(for more detailed outline, see [Preseason Phase](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17ioVe3i7MSX7AisctLm9CVR9S_sBfgj9xTBDxiAkCG8/edit?gid=851797799#gid=851797799))

# Big Pieces
## “Weekly Rocks”
###  Warmup and Movement Prep
***Desired Duration:** 8-12mins. Building some foundational strength, or setting the tone on a lighter note, but should not be the focal point of any session.*
In the preseason phase, introducing the primary ideas of how we operate as a team, as most teams may be used to more “traditional” dynamic-warmup routines.
- Isometric work to build tissue resilience, promote joint health, and strength in key areas used in sprints/jumps. 
- Blending or substituting movement games on days that may have less “exciting work,” like weights-days.
Speed days are likely to have more structure to the warmup, weights days are likely to use more movement games, and X-Factor days may have a mix.
- #### Movement Games — [[2026 Warmup Ideas#Small-Sided Games|Menu]] in 2025-26 Warmup Ideas
	- When utilized, take up the entire warmup time.
	- A great way to start lower-intensity days like **Weights**, as it gets energy going among the team while also preparing them to lift.
		- Can also be done on **X-Factor** days as it potentiates good performances
		- Not as useful on **Speed** days, those are when we like to stay a little more traditional in our warmup protocol (as it mimics competition-routine)
- #### ISOs — Choose 1-2 from Menu
	- **Leg Staples** — SL Stand, ISO-Lunge
		- (both done for analgesic, 90s-2min)
	- **Lower-Leg** — Foam-Roller Calf-Bridge 
		- (done for STR, 2-3 x 30-45s)
- #### Mobility — Menu
	- **Structured Drills** — Lunge + Reach (or Lunge + Twist)
	- **Movement Exploration** — Crawls, Crouches, and Rolls
		- A great transition to CNS/Priming, as it bleeds nicely into speed drills
### CNS/Priming
***Desired Duration:** 10-15mins. The primary opportunity to focus on coach-cueing and technique, before we get into the main work and let athletes focus on high-outputs with less direct cueing.*
In the preseason phase, aiming to do a lot of constraints-driven stability work as we’re teaching the patterns. Things like hands on hips, holding a PVC pipe overhead, etc. 
By proxy, this will slow down the drill and force the athlete to think about the movement, rather than jumping straight into full speed running with potential compensation patterns or poor technical strategies.
- #### Menu of “Big Hits” — (see [[CNS-Priming]] for complete list of ideas)
	- **Speed Days** — generally where we place our more traditional speed drills and priming activities specific to either Acceleration or MaxV. Deep-Tier plyos are a good way to start and transition from Movement Prep, working to more high-intensity activities by end.
	- **X-Factor Days** — A great time to lean more into plyometric variations for well-rounded athletic development outside of our traditional speed prep
		- (inspiration from [[Boo Shexnayder]], etc.)
	- **Weights Days** — can use Med-Ball throws or sled-pushes, but often times not including a CNS Primer and just getting right into lifting.
		- If we implement priming, needs to be something force oriented.
### Main Work
***Desired Duration:** 15-20mins, or more on Weights-Days (as they absorb Accessory-Time into their content). The bulk of the content in a practice.*
> [!NOTE] Constraints, not Cues
For Speed/X-Factor drills, we may use **constraints** to focus on aspects of technique, but focus will be on outputs, rather than coach-provided corrections and technique.
- #### Speed
	- Exposures at least 2x, preferably 3x p/wk  — Usually can fit a third exposure in some of the X-Factor content if it’s not direct linear-sprinting work.
		- X-Factor Examples — Curve-Running, Change-of-Direction, Agility-Work, Decelerations
	- Sleds at least 1x p/wk, preferably 2x — Medium to Heavy, aiming for acceleration focus in this early-season
		- Velocity Decrement — anywhere from 30-55% vDec
- #### X Factor
	- Gathering baseline data on Horizontal and Vertical Jumps — CMJ, Broad, etc
	- Introducing Higher-Intensity Plyos — Bounding, Marshalls, Hopping, Depth-Drops and Depth-Jumps, Hurdle-Hops
- #### Weights
	- ISO-Testing — starting out our weights-days with some kind of diagnostic measure using the Voltra (see [[ISO-Testing]] for Menu)
	- Statics (Isometrics) — (see [[Weights-Statics]] for Menu)
		- (Anything from the [[1x20]] ISO-selection, in the 1x15/1x10 stages, is also on the table here)
	- Dynamics — (see [[Weights-Dynamics]] for Menu)
		- (Anything from [[1x20]], in any stage, is also on the table here)
### Accessories
***Desired Duration:** 6-10mins on Speed/X-Factor Days. Finishing our session hitting underutilized or under-developed muscle groups, namely in the hips and lower leg, but also core.*
(see [[Accessories]] for more specific ideas)
- May be a good idea to do these “circuit-style” utilizing 3-4 coaches supervising a different exercise (with 0-2 independent if they require minimal supervision, like monster walks), and athletes rotate through.
	- A lot of our accessory patterns are unilateral, so athletes could perform one side per round.
## Track & Field Combine — New Element
A new element for the 2026 season. Expanding the legacy Speed-Trials into a 5-event pentathlon, split across two days within the first week of practices. (integrates with the [[Middle-School Tryouts]] update for this season)
- Wednesday — X-Factor Jumps-Testing
	- CMJ
	- Standing Broad Jump
	- (for Distance) 800m Time-Trial
- Friday — Speed Trials
	- 30m Sprint
	- Med-Ball Overhead Throw
	- CMJ
## Speed Trials — 3/13/26
