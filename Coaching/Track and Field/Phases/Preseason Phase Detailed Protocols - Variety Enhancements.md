## Suggested Integration by Theme

### Option 1 — Blended Approach
- Add game-based warmups as alternative for weights days (Option 3 variant)
- Include Safari Warmup elements (crawls, crouches, rolls)
- Add paired circuit work as time-efficient option
- Include partnered core work
- Med-Ball Relay for competitive element

### Option 2 — Mobility/ROM-Focused
- Emphasize Safari Warmup (full protocol)
- Include deeper ISO holds (Regular ISO Lunge 90s, Extended ISO Lunge 60s)
- Add Hip-Work ROM/Mobility (Max Flex/Extend, Max ER/IR)
- Include constraint drills with slower tempo
- Movement exploration emphasis (Duck-Walk to Roll, Lateral Bear-Gallops)

### Option 3 — Activation/Strength-Focused
- Add EDT-style paired circuits for higher volume
- Include Handstand Hold for upper body strength
- Add resisted work progressions (Sled Marches, Sled Prime-Times, Sled Bounds)
- Include competitive elements (1v1 Cone Tip-Off, Med-Ball Relay)
- Add specific jump variations (Capt. Morgans, Banded Booms, TTT-FF Drill)
- Include all Sprint Bridge variations

## Notes

- Many 2024-25 exercises use paired/partnered approaches which add engagement and efficiency
- Game-based warmups add variety and keep sessions engaging (Jochum influence)
- EDT-style circuits allow higher volume in time-efficient manner
- Constraint drills (One-Arm Sprint) add technical focus without heavy cueing
- Specific equipment variations (Stealth Sled, Exergenie, Plyomat) offer different training stimuli
