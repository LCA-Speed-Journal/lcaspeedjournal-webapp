# Programming

General programming concepts and training frameworks

## General

General programming principles and training approaches

- [[A Simple Plan]]: [[Tony Holler]]'s simple plan for coaching track and field including keeping sprint practice brief, timing sprinters in short sprints, record/rank/publish, sprint max 3x p/wk (one lactate day), X-Factor days, separate distance kids, jump training, and hurdling principles.
- [[APEX Ready]]: 20-week program by [[Joe Pedulla]] to prepare for APEX, covering GPP phase with speed days (early acceleration), lift days (force-lower, upper dynamic), and structured programming with throws, jumps, technical blocks, main speed work, and ISO holds.
- [[High-Frequency Training]]: [[Jake Tuura]] principles on high-frequency training covering higher frequency = more protein synthesis, stimulus-recovery-adaptation balance, 6-day split (4 primary, 2 secondary), daily training components (warmup/activation, CNS warmup, max strength, assistance/pump), and rep schemes.
- [[Individualizing Training in Large Groups]]: [[Adam Vogel]] (Homewood Flossmoor) approach to individualizing training in large group settings covering HF weightroom context (2800 students, 20 sections, 13 staff), effective grouping strategies, creating individualized S&C system with principle-based approach, strategic grouping (sports, positional needs, seasons, individual needs), and procedures/protocols for flexible system.
- [[Periodization with Parno]]: [[Chris Parno]] periodization framework covering verbiage and intent (volume, intensity, density), generalized neuromuscular/energy-system breakdown, absolute speed (max intensity 30-80m, full recovery), speed endurance (80-150m per rep, 300-900m total volume), and training prescriptions.
- [[Pragmatic Coaching, Skills vs Strength]]: [[Tim Riley]] podcast episode with [[Joe Pedulla]] covering pragmatic coaching principles, skills vs strength balance, and references to Pedulla's Pragmatic Principles course.
- [[S&C Framework of Training Stressors]]: [[Colton Razo]] (Ohio State) framework covering governing laws (overload principle, law of accommodation, law of specificity, law of individualization), categorization of exercise (GPE, SPE, SDE, CE, Event/Sport), and training stressor organization influenced by [[Boo Shexnayder]] and Soviet systems.
- [[Technique-Session – Dribbles]]: Technique session structure including MB drills (backward overhead throws, underhand throws, chest passes, underhand toss for height), submax 30yd builds, toe-up prime-times, single-leg cycling, dribbles (ankle, calf, knee, MB dribbles), MB rainbows, MB low-walk, and barefoot walking.
- [[Triphasic-Style GPP]]: Triphasic training general physical preparation covering aerobic phase (Aerobic EDT, long ISOs), lactic phase (Lactic EDT, moderate ISOs, long OSC reps), and alactic phase (short ISOs OVC, short OSC reps).
- [[Tuura's Takeaways on 1x20]]: [[Jake Tuura]]'s key takeaways from 1x20 method covering effectiveness for youth/beginners, overload prerequisite for growth, criteria for specialized strength exercises, starting vs explosive strength, speed-strength relationship, exercise volume (20+ exercises), neuromuscular base of injuries, blood flow benefits, and exercise transfer principles.
