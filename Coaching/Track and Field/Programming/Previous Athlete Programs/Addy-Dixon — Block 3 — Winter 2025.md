# Weekly View — Themes
Day		Theme		Details		
"Day-1: Upper A" — Force-Focus
	Combining Push+Pull, focusing on overall force. Some lower-body plyos in the warmup, hitting early-week when fresh.		
"Day-2: Lower A” — Force-Focus
	Oly-Lifting coming into play 2x p/wk now, since they're fantastic for power output. Otherwise, the basics: Squat, Hinge, and Accessories.		
(REST DAY) — (Optional Mobility)
	(No lifting, but some mobility stuff.)		
"Day-3:  Upper-B" — Volume-Focus
	Similar to Day-1, combining all our upper patterns into the same lift, and adding a little bit of plyo work into the warmup.		
Day-4: Lower-B — Dynamic Focus
	Similar to Day-2—Olys, SQ, Hinge, Accessories— but more focused on single-leg work (i.e. "the quickest way to get really strong legs.")		
# Block-3 Week-by-Week — Themes
Week		Theme		Details		
Week 1		GPP A — Badger Protocol
	Starting to work some ISO-Holds into our main sets, but still keeping the feel of a main set.		
Week 2		GPP B — Badger Protocol
	Getting better at control on our main lifts, Week 2 of this should be where it starts to make sense.		
Week 3		Strength — Eccentric Microcycle
	Now that we've gotten better at control, let's focus on the lowering segment of the movement for two weeks.
Week 4		Strength — Eccentric Microcycle
	Should be getting stronger, particularly in that ECC Phase, which is perfect before the next microcycle.		
Week 5		Strength — Isometric Microcycle
	Incorporating ISO-Holds at the bottom of each rep of our main lifts, capping off our "control" block strong.		
Week 6		Strength — Isometric Microcycle
	Finishing off our General-Prep, Strength-Focused chunk still in ISOs, but starting to work on a faster ECC so we can stop more aggressively.
