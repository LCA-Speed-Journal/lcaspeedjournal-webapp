# Tony Gets an Inquiry
**Women’s coach trying to rebuild/restructure a girls program.** 
Not familiar with sprinters, wants to know if there’s any difference to working with girls. 
	Workouts, advice, etc.

> [!NOTE] Tony’s List, below, results in **A Simple Plan** for coaching Track & Field.
> - Keep your sprint practice **ridiculously brief.** 
 > - **Time your sprinters** in short sprints. 
> - **Record, Rank, and Publish.** 
> - Don’t sprint more than **three times a week.** 
> - One day of the week (a speed day) needs to be a **lactate** workout.
> - The other days need to be **a break from sprinting.** We call those alternative days, *X-Factor*. 
> - Keep **distance kids (≥800m) separate** from sprinters. 
> - Allow **jump training to take the place of a speed day** or do jumps in addition to sprinting. (remember, sprint workouts are ridiculously short — *microdosing*). 
> - Exact same principles as jumps apply to **hurdling**.

# Breaking Down the Pieces of **A Simple Plan**
## Speed Days
Don’t warm up. Don’t stretch.  
Short warmup, then time some sprints.

>[!NOTE]- The Atomic Speed Workout
> **Ten speed drills:**
> - fast march, skips, 
> - high knees, butt kicks, 
> - 5 box jumps, bounding, 
> - prime times x2, 
> - butt-kick and reach x2, 
> - one falling start into a full sprint.
> 
Then, **time three short sprints.** Average the best two, then *Record-Rank-Publish*.

> [!INFO]- Hand-Timing Flys
>- If you only have a stopwatch, time three 40s (boys hurdle marks are 10 yards apart). 
> The shortest fly you can time with a stopwatch would probably be 30 yards. 
> Have a trustworthy slow kid drop a hand at the start of they fly. 
> Use a hurdle at the start and end of the fly as a visual marker.
### *Jumps Caveat*
Remember, jumps practice can take the place of speed work. 
	Plainfield North: jumps coach usually does jump work in addition to speed work. 
	Tries to work with each jump one day per week (HJ one day, LJ one day, TJ one day). 
Tony’s Advice: encourage specialty coaches to “make appointments” with kids on weekends. 
	Plainfield North doesn’t practice on non-school days.
 Jump as little as possible. Keep jumpers as fresh as possible. 
	 Jumpers who will never run the 200 and 400 should never do lactate workouts.
## X-Factor
Remember, keep your X-Factor days ridiculously SHORT.  
	Didn’t sign up to be the after-school day care coordinator. 
	Practice 45 minutes and turn the kids loose. 
And, no, DON’T DO A “COOL-DOWN”. However, most of PNTrack kids do something after practice. 
	Some play basketball. Football players go to the weight room. 
**Goal:** Every kid feels better after a workout than they did before their workout 
	(with the exception of lactic).

> [!NOTE]- *Baby’s First X-Factor Workout*
> ♦ Wickets (10-12 minutes)  
> ♦ Hurdle Mobility (10-12 minutes)  
> ♦ Depth Jumps and Assisted Plyos (10-12 minutes)
> You can do anything on X-Factor days as long as it’s alactic and not spiked-up sprinting and timing. 
> - Remember, on X-Factor days, never do lactate work (≥10s of intensity) and never do aerobic work (long, slow, conversational work).
#### Wickets
15-20 meter run-up and SPRINT. Hurdles are six feet apart. 
We are not working on an acceleration stride pattern, we are working on max-speed mechanics. 
	We do strange things with our arms in order inject some chaos into the equation. 
	Try seven-foot wickets and tell your kids to SPRINT without REACHING. 
	Try five foot wickets and tell your kids to be fast with the ups and downs (like pistons). 
	Try one line of five feet and one line of seven.
## Lactic
Never do a lactate workout more than twice in a week. 
	Meets count as lactate workouts. 
	Lactate workouts (and meets) take the place of a sprint day too.

# The Recipe

![400](http://trackfootballconsortium.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-06-19-at-3.25.06-pm.png)

It’s interesting the percentage breakdown by colors: 40% yellow, 20% red, 40% green. 
	Twice as many OFF-DAYS (green) as lactate + meet days (red) is a good indicator that **rest is the priority.**
## General Parameters for Practice Weeks

| Type          | M      | T                      | W                      | Th          | F                        | Sa/Su                            |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Open**      | Speed  | X-Fact                 | Speed                  | X-Fact      | Lactic                   | —                                |
| **Sa. Meet**  | Lactic | *S. Holiday* or X-Fact | Speed                  | X-Fact      | *S. Holiday* or Handoffs | ==**Meet**==                     |
| **T/Sa Meet** | X-Fact | ==**Meet**==           | *S. Holiday* or X-Fact | Speed       | X-Fact + Handoffs        | ==**Meet**==                     |
| **T/F Meet**  | X-Fact | ==**Meet**==           | *S. Holiday* or X-Fact | X, Handoffs | ==**Meet**==             | (Su would be perfect Sprint Day) |

> [!QUESTION]- *“But if we have meets on Tuesday and Friday, we never really practice!”*
> No shit!
> We schedule like this in April because weather will often cause multiple cancelations. 
> By the way, always be the first coach voting to cancel a meet. Track is a tough sell to kids. Track in 40-degree pouring rain is stupid. Cancel and get a day of rest. 
> **Rest is more important than any workout you’ll ever do!**

> [!QUESTION]- *“But when will we get faster if all we are doing is recovering from meets?”*
> Yep. This is a problem. 
> You won’t get faster running two meets per week. If you are not careful, your kids will get slower. 
> Even worse, your kids may get injured. This is why you can’t go “Clyde Hart” on your your kids all winter. 
> You can’t run laps in the hallways or miles on the frozen tundra. 
> Sprinting (or at the very least, acceleration and doing lots of plyos) must be done all winter. 
> In matter of fact, sprinting must be done all summer, all fall, AND all winter—pure speed doesn’t improve during the season. 
> My sprinters get faster at the 100, 200, and 400 but they get slower in the 10m fly. 
> Lactate work does NOT build speed. 
> Anything you do for more than five seconds will NOT improve speed.

# General Rules
- Keep lactate workouts away from meets and sprint workouts (48-hour hangover).
- Weekly algorithm: **Speed + Lactate + Meets = 3**
- If you have three meets in a week, God forbid, you get NO speed workouts and no lactate workouts. 
- Never do aerobic work with sprinters, EVER. 
	- This method of training will train ALL sprinters – 100, 200, 400, 110 HH, 300 INT, 4×1, 4×2, 4×4, jumpers, and vaulters. 
	- This method of training allows you to *Sprint as fast as possible, as often as possible, while staying as fresh as possible*. 
- Tired is not the goal, tired is the enemy.

# **Happy sprinters are your best recruiters.**
