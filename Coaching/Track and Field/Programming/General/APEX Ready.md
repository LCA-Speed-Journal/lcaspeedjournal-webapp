20wk Program to prepare for APEX.
# Program Progression
##  Meso-1 — General Preparation and Strength-Building Block
We need to build the muscle-foundation before we try to translate that into more power/speed.

| Week   | Theme                           | Details                                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | GPP A — Badger Protocol         | Badger Protocol = "The ISO-Sandwich."  <br>First and last-reps are ISO-pauses, with straight reps in the middle.                               |
| Week 2 | GPP B — Badger Protocol         | Second week of Badger Protocol, starting to get in the swing of the program split before moving into focused work.                             |
| Week 3 | Strength — Eccentric Microcycle | After building some general control, focusing on the eccentric because emphasizing the lowering is great for driving strength/size up fast.    |
| Week 4 | Strength — Eccentric Microcycle | By second week of eccentrics, should be feeling some strength bump. Pivoting to ISO-focus for the next two weeks to finish the strength block. |
| Week 5 | Strength — Isometric Microcycle | Incorporating ISO-Holds at the bottom of each rep of our main lifts: this is going to blend building strength with power off the bottom.       |
| Week 6 | Strength — Isometric Microcycle | Finish off our General-Prep, Strength-Focused meso still in ISOs, but starting to work on a faster ECC so we can stop more aggressively.       |
## Meso-2 — Power/SPP Blocks
Power/Specific-Prep Blocks, taking the strength we’ve built and sharpening it up for more forceful outputs.

| Week   | Theme                  | Details                                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | (Deload) Power — Intro | The deload will be more about knocking down some of the weight this week, but Intent will still be high. Working on lighter loads, but faster. |
| Week 2 | Power — Progressing    | Now that we've had a lighter week, starting to add some volume back in, but still with this power-focus in mind.                               |
| Week 3 | Power — Progressing    | Three full weeks of power, then we start to work more specific prep to build up the event-specific skills.                                     |
| Week 4 | Specific Prep — Intro  | Returning to more volume with the lifting, but spread over more sets so we  <br>don't build up a ton of fatigue.                               |
| Week 5 | SPP — Progressing      | Second week of specific prep, should be feeling faster and more explosive by this point.                                                       |
| Week 6 | SPP — Progressing      | Last week of SPP, then we run it back for another strength microcycle, this time with a clusters-style approach.                               |
## Meso-3 — Strength-Repeat
Shorter block to re-up our strength outputs, taking a week to ease back then hitting three weeks of clusters.

| Week   | Theme                      | Details                                                                                             |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | (Deload) Strength —  Intro | Straight sets to ease back into strength, should feel like a gentle deload without losing momentum. |
| Week 2 | Strength — Clusters        | Boy oh boy do clusters work for blending strength with keeping power around.                        |
| Week 3 | Strength — Clusters        | Clusters Pt. 2: Electric Boogaloo                                                                   |
| Week 4 | Strength — Clusters        | Finish off our strength-repeat, then it's back  <br>into power and speed.                           |
## Meso-4 — Capstone Block
Two weeks of power, two weeks of speed, ending with a taper and peak.

| Week   | Theme                                | Details                                                                                                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 5 | Power —  <br>Putting it All Together | Moving back into higher-speed lifting to conserve resources so we can really pour into speed. Heavy is a trap right now. We want explosive. |
| Week 6 | Power —  <br>Putting it All Together |                                                                                                                                             |
| Week 7 | Speed —  <br>Taper and Peak          | Lowering our reps for speed work, the big focus  for these last two weeks is refining the  start for a fast 40.                             |
| Week 8 | Speed —  <br>Taper and Peak          |                                                                                                                                             |
# Weekly Split
| Day                                | Theme                                    | Details                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Day-1:  <br>Speed                  | Short Accelerations                      | Day-1 is more priming, seeing as it's hard to tell how rested you'll be coming off the weekend. Sharp, snappy, but forceful. Heavy legs tomorrow. |
| Day-2:  <br>Lower A                | Force-Focus                              | Olympic Lifting + Back-Squat as the main-lifts, as well as accessories to make sure we're well-rounded.                                           |
| Day-3:  <br>Upper-A + Conditioning | Volume-Focus  <br>+ Mile-Prep            | Bench building, along with upper strength-support, then finishing with first conditioning session to prep for the mile.                           |
| Day-4:  <br>Conditioning           | Aerobic Conditioning  <br>+ Arms-Support | Yes, there's dedicated support for arms.  <br>Warming up with steady-state conditioning, can split between implements if time-total adds up.      |
| Day 5: Speed  <br>+ Lower-B        | Early MaxV  <br>+ Single-Leg Support     | Single-leg focus is "the quickest way to get really strong legs." Preceded by our second speed session of the week, MaxV focused.                 |
| Day-6:  <br>Upper-B                | Dynamic Upper                            | Similar to Day-2—Olys, SQ, Hinge, Accessories— but more focused on single-leg work (i.e. "the quickest way to get really strong legs.")           |

		- A very under rated thing with buildups that you need to focus on is controlled effort. You want to run hard here as relaxed as possible. 
		  Don't muscle up or try hard, just float and practice fluid movement. 
		- We also want to work maxV mechanics by staying upright and trying to cycle the thigh/hip back and down as you approach each ground contact.
