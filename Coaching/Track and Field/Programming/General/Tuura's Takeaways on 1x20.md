## 1. The 1×20 Method is effective for youth or beginner athletes.
- The body adapts more readily to lower intensity strength exercises
	(greater growth and development of the muscles, joints, and support structures without fatigue and chance of injury).
- For beginners, doing one set will bring the same gains as doing two or more sets.
	One set is more than adequate to sufficiently deplete energy supplies (and produce supercompensation).
- Because the last few repetitions in the routine are high-intensity, they are effective in developing greater strength. 
	The earlier repetitions (approximately 11-15) favor the development of muscular endurance (as they are low-intensity).
## 2.  Overload is a Prerequisite for Growth, and yet isn’t covered in sport.
When playing sport, muscles do not get proportionately stronger in each type of contraction because they do not experience overload 
	(it is approximately the same in each game or practice)
And yet, overload is a prerequisite for gains in any type of strength. Suggests we need to supplement this.
## 3.  Criteria for specialized strength exercises (as they relate to a sports specific skill):
- Must duplicate the sports movement (same neuromuscular pathway)
- Must utilize the same range of motion (ROM)
- Must be the same type of muscular contraction
- Example: [Knee Drive Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI_3FTEA6Uk): 
	- same neuromuscular pathway as running, 
	- develops strength in same ROM as running,
	- is executed in an explosive manner as seen in running.
## 4.  Starting Strength vs Explosive Strength
“The lighter the implement you have to move and the shorter the distance, the more your starting strength becomes important.  
The heavier the resistance and the longer the distance, the more important your explosive strength becomes.”
## 5.  The Speed-Strength Relationship.
“Increased strength can increase running speed. But, if you gain too much strength, speed will decrease.”
	It’s a Catch-22 situation. 
You need some strength for increases in speed, but shouldn’t tip the scale too far.
## 6.  “With high-intensity training, you can only manage about 6 exercises.  
With 1 x 20, you can usually do more than 20 different exercises.  
It takes over 20 exercises to cover all the major joints and joint action in the body.”
## 7.  “Most injuries have a neuromuscular base.
How the exercises are executed plays the most important role in injury prevention.”
## 8.  1 x 20 causes greater blood flow which leads to:
- Increased capillary density 
	- (more efficient waste product removal from working muscle)
- Greater growth of ligaments and tendons
	- (strength and thickness) 
## 9.  [[Dr. Michael Yessis]]’s findings on exercise and transfer to sport:
- The [good morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7yBaMRxz98) and [back raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQkKEgL3nbs&index=9&list=PLFrFkgTLiksvrZfepom8_4aoq_OAVM2_k&t=0s) exercise are usually needed before undertaking the squat for most participants.
- Along with the [heel (calf) raise exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xqO_tVAfec), it is recommended that you also do [dorsiflexion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KusCNeUXqUs&list=PLFrFkgTLiksvrZfepom8_4aoq_OAVM2_k&index=25), ankle abduction, and ankle adduction if your sport requires running and cutting actions.
- When you have correct running technique and do this exercise ([Band Paw Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zn6yBGOHc)), the chances of injury to the hamstrings are greatly minimized, if not completely eliminated.
- The [Back Raise with a Twist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBDgJdNcvb0&index=13&list=PLFrFkgTLiksvrZfepom8_4aoq_OAVM2_k) is especially important in sports such as golf in which a backswing is taken.
	- Generation of most rotational power requires separation of the hips and shoulders.
- For full abdominal muscle development, you need the 45 degree Sit Up, [Reverse Sit Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GklpSYLtbec&list=PLFrFkgTLiksvrZfepom8_4aoq_OAVM2_k&index=18), and the Reverse Trunk Twist.
- The best exercise for shoulder rotation in throwing and hitting is the [Russian Twist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGN2VSbKqaA).
- The three most important exercises for improving running speed:
	- [knee drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI_3FTEA6Uk),
	- [paw back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zn6yBGOHc), 
	- [heel raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xqO_tVAfec).
## 10.  “The quicker you gain strength, the faster you will lose it.
The slower you gain strength, the longer you will keep it.”
