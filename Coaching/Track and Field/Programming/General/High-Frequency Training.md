# Principles
## Higher-Frequency = More Protein Synthesis
(as cited in [[Christian Thibaudeau]]’s natural-lifting 6-day split)
## Stimulus – Recovery – Adaptation
(as cited from [[Mike Israetel]])
Training disrupts homeostasis, but we need to train to grow. Need to adjust how recoverable each session is to allow balance of recovery and stimulus.
Suggestion: training body parts more often than once or twice a week is better for hypertrophy purposes. 
	Training strength and power in less demanding ways allows you to train them more often.
# Training
6 Day Split: 4 Primary, 2 Secondary
- Upper: 2 Primary (Bench, OHP), 1 Secondary (Incline Press)
- Lower: 2 Primary (DL, SQ), 1 Secondary (Unilateral)
## Daily Training Components
#### WARM-UP & ACTIVATION:
Prepare for the day’s training
#### CNS WARM-UP: 
Explosive training to “turn on” and “excite” the central nervous system with movement- or sport-specific exercises.
#### MAX STRENGTH: 
Compound movements – “meat and potatoes” of force and power production.
The rep scheme used for all strength exercises are:
- Warm-Up (e.g. 10 @ light, 5 @ medium, 3 @ heavy, 1 attempts building up to 9/10 difficulty)
- 1 x 1 @ 9/10 Difficulty
- 1 x 3 @ 80-85%
- 1 x 5 @ 70-75%
	*on upper body days, Max Strength Pushes (B) are followed by Max Strength Pulls (C)*
For days 5 & 6, lower intensity means are used
#### ASSISTANCE and PUMP:
- Strengthen weaknesses
- Develop structure
- Work on Limitations that affect the Max Strength exercises
- Maximize Hypertrophy
