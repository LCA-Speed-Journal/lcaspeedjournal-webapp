# Individualizing Training in Large Groups
[[Adam Vogel]] — Homewood Flossmoor

## HF Weightroom
- 2800 Students at the school, ~1200 in one or more sports
- 20 Sections During the day (growth of almost 10x during Adam’s time with the school)
	- 13x Staff Members (6x Performance Staff, 7x PE Staff)
	- Vast majority of strength staff are also sport coaches, some multiple sports
	- Additionally, juniors and seniors who have been in the program 3-4 years act as peer leaders within the sections
## Effective Grouping and Individualization
Common Problems:
- Sport Specific Individualization, if any (do you just do GPP for everyone to hit lowest-common?)
- How to account for athlete-specific flexibility/mobility deficits without detracting from program
	- Allow for Progressions/Regressions, as well as modifications
	- Individualization based on Phases of Development
- How to handle Large Training Groups
	- Have a General Plan that gets more specific
	- Limit Transitions
- Time Constraints with Large-Group Settings
	- Stay Simple: Add Layers (Complexity) when they can prove efficiency
## Creating an Individualized S&C System
- Taking a Principle-Based Approach to S&C
	- Procedures — things established before starting (written program, rack-assignments)
	- Practices — what is done during the session
	- Protocols — adjustments made due to practices (what can be done to adjust)
### Strategic Grouping and Individualization
- Sports — Linear, Vertical, Rotational, Contact (can be multiple, generally just one)
- Positional Needs (track events, football positions, etc)
- Seasons — In-Season vs Offseason
- Individual Needs — Attack the Limiting Factors
### Procedures/Protocols for a Flexible System
#### Procedures
- Adam uses [[Joe Kenn]] and [[Mike Boyle]]’s style of systemizing
- Starts with 1x20 for super beginners — freshman did for an entire semester
- Post-Activation-Potentiation — pairing slower movements with explosive movements
- “There are no solutions, only trade-offs”
- Boyle’s Ideas
	- Big Multijoint movements — 1-2x p/wk at least
	- Knee-Hinge (Squat-Patterns, DL can count) 
		- just worry about getting to 1.7x BW, then start looking more at patterning for power
		- Front-Squat until 1.3x BW, then they earn the right to Back-Squat
			- Band-System: green band to back-squat, purple to move to power
			- Connects to rewarding performance through multiple avenues
	- Bilateral and Unilateral Work
	- Frontal-Plane (Lunging, Good-Morning)
	- Horizontal Pressing / Vertical Pressing (above/below 45deg)
	- A few more pulling patterns than pushing patterns
	- Concussion Reduction / Contact Prep
	- Shoulder Complex
	- Rotational Core-Work
	- Posterior Chain — Clean-Grip DL, get that to 2x BW then move to Trap-Bar
	- Ankle/Foot Complex
## Training Structure and Sport-Individualization
- 15 Essentials, 15 Added-Essentials (23 for some groups)
	- 15x during the week, 15-18x after school
### Weekly Structure
- Two Tri-sets in a class-period — A (1, 2, 3) and B (1, 2, 3)
	- Can sub out patterns depending on in-season, out of season, sport-needs, etc.
- After school, 75mins — 3x p/wk p/gender for sports (M-W-F for girls, T-Th-F for boys)
- Undulating Structure for in-season, more linear blocks for out-of-season
### Phases of Development
- Movement → Strength → Power → Speed → Capacity
- Refer to general development of the athlete, not necessarily a defined timeline
- Just using different components with each phase, focusing something different
	- Movement is mostly everything
	- Strength is mostly STR with some power
	- Power is mostly Power with microdosed Strength
	- Speed maintains qualities but leans into velocity
## Decision-Tree Modeling, Individualization, and VBT
- Allowing athletes to auto-regulate based on velocity targets
	- 0.25 m/s over, adding load, and vice versa for 0.25 m/s under
