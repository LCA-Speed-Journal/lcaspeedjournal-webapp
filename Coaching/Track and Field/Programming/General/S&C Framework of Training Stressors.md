# S&C Framework of Training Stressors

[[Colton Razo]] — Ohio State
- Razo.10@osu.edu
- Influenced by [[Boo Shexnayder]]
- Influences from the old Soviet Systems [[Verkoshansky]], etc.
## But Why?
A strong working model of training categorizations allows for the following:
- Continual Innovation    
- Versatility    
- Ability to see other ways of thinking  
Clearer guidelines emerge after properly consolidating the stressors.
## Governing Laws of Thinking
### Overload Principle
Detraining → retaining → stimulating. 
- Need sufficient recovery between similar CNS-Intensive Stressors
- Need to allocate sufficient volume and intensity to yield improvements
### Law of Accomodation
SAID Principle. 
- Need to use general, general specific, and specific training means
### Law of Specificity
To get better at a task, you need to do that specific task
### Law of Individualization
Each organism is going to have its own unique response to a given training stressor
- Classify athletes based on individual physical preparedness — will dictate appropriate training means
## Categorization of Exercise
(see [[Bondarchuk]] and his description of these things)
### General Preparatory Exercises (GPE)
Do not imitate the competitive event, do not train the specific systems.
- Very all-purpose, used for general coordination and recovery.
- Bodyweight work, calisthenics, etc
	- a lot of low-hanging fruit here. A lot.

### Specific Preparatory Exercises (SPE)
Do not imitate the movement, but train the same major muscle groups and psychological systems.
(Example: Throws, Sprints, and Jumps)
- Olympic Lifts
- Max-STR and Special-STR (Explosive-Jumps and Med-Ball work)
### Specific Development Exercises (SDE)
Exercises that repeat the competitive event in training, but in its separate parts.
- Example 1: Triple Jumpers — Bounding Exercises (with or without load)
- Example 2: Discus Throwers — Stand Throws
- Example 3: Endurance — Hill Work / Hill-Sprints
### Competitive Exercises (CE)
Exercises (any activities done in training) that are identical, or almost identical, to the competition event.
- Example 1: Triple Jumpers — Full-Jumps (varied approach length)
- Example 2: Shotput Throwers — Full-Throws (glide or spin)
- Example 3: Sprinters — various forms of sprint work (accels, flys)
### Event or Sport
## Definable Strength Qualities
- Absolute STR — how much contractile force an individual can display
- Accelerative STR — moving submax load with high-speed
	- Force production over a given distance, when time is a constraint
- Starting STR — force generated instantaneously/prior to external movement
- Explosive STR — the ability to produce max-force in the shortest possible time
- STR-Endurance — ability to sustain outputs against external load

## Exercise Prescription Continuum

### Max-Effort Method (85% or more)
Primarily trains absolute strength.
- Aiming to increase absolute-STR or max ISO-STR.
- General Force-Capacity.
### Dynamic-Effort Method (under 70%)
Primary trains accel-STR and the subcategories of STR-Speed and Speed-STR.
- Aim to increase RFD
- Increase transfer from general force-capacity to more explosive work.
- Key driver of peak power output development
### Repetition Effort Method
Primarily trains STR-Endurance and acts as tissue-prep.
- Increasing muscular hypertrophy
## Means and Methods
### Max-Effort
- General Markers: 1.8-2.0x BW Squat (1.4-1.6x BW for females)
- BB Back-SQ, BB Bench, Unilateral SQ-Variants
- Accomodating Resistance, Quasi-ISO (with near-max loads) or ISO contraction
#### Prilepin’s Chart:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Percent|Reps/Sets|Optimal|Total Range|
|55-65|3-6|24|18-30|
|70-80|3-6|18|12-24|
|80-90|2-4|15|10-20|
|90+|1-2|4|10|
### Dynamic-Effort
- Peak Power output happens with 30-60% 1RM (velocities of 0.75-1.3 m/s)
- Peak power output for Oly-Lifting happens at 75-85% 1RM
- Olys,, BB-SQ, BB-Bench, BB-Jumps, Throws
- Clusters work well for the Olys (1-2 Reps, 15-20s, 1-2 Reps, etc)
#### Dynamic Effort Chart

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Percent|Avg m/s|Reps p/session|
|70-80|0.7-0.8|6-12|
|60-70|00.8-0.9|8-15|
|50-60|0.9-1.0|10-20|
|40-60|1.0-1.1|15-25|
|30-40|1.1-1.2|25-30|
### Repetition Effort
- Getting into some nitty gritty about myofibraillar vs sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
	- Not as much of a use case for us, more for the sub-elite population
- Small Differences between myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic:
	- 2-4 Exercises vs 3-6, 
	- 3-4 Sets vs 4-8, 
	- 5-8 reps vs 10-15, 
	- 70-80% vs 60-70%, 
	- 90-150s rest vs 30-90.

## Conjugation
Working to train all qualities/categorizations at all times (just adjusting volume to accommodate)
Example: Jumps Group
- Block High Pull (3x3 @ 75–80-80) — Razor Curl I(3x3)
- Block Clean (4x3 @ 75-75-80-80)

- BB Squat Jump (4x3 @ 30-40%)
- Incline BB Bench (4x5/3/3/5 @ 70-75-80–70) — Chin-Ups (4x3-6)
Example 2: Throws Group (M-Tu-Th Construct)
