# Verbiage and Intent is Important
Volume — Total amount of Training
- Progressive loading/unloading based on time of saeeason and stimulus-goal
Intensity —  Measured Difficulty of Training/Activity
- Percentage, based off some type orf testing data or PR persformance
Density — How Often a Theme is Present within a Training Plan
- High weeekly speed density = multiple sessions in a week
# Generalized Neuromuscular / Energy-System Breakdown
(see [[Gary Winklarr]]’s work on Bioenergetics)

## Absolute Speed
### What — Max Intensity (fastest 10-30m segment)
- Generally, 30-80m reps depending on age/strength
- Full recovery between stets and reps (1-1.5:1 ratio p/10m segment)
### When — Accel emphasis, then MaxV
- “Driving, Pushing, Projection”
- “Push yourself Tall”
### How — Combos of high-intensity over 30-80m
- Fly-Runs (with 30m Accel-Zone)
- Short Accels (30-50m)
- Ladder Flys (Fly-10, Fly-20, Fly-30, all with 30m Accel)
## Speed Endurance
### What — Max-Intensity while Fighting Fatigue
- 80-150m per rep, 300-900m of total volume
- Increased technical focus after maxV
- Recoveries based off overall goal/distance
### When — Locks in Speed Qualities
- Concerted effort to build quality accel and maxV capacities first
- Time-Trials, longer testing reps, and early-season races ARE SPEED ENDURANCE
	- Might never get to true speed-endurance during a shorter HS season…what takes its place?
### How — Repeat 100’s, 120’s, 150’s
- 3 x 120 — Fast as Possible, 8-10min recovery, focusing seamless transition
- 150, 120, 100 w/8-12min recovery
### Sidebar — Short-Speed Endurance (ASSE/GSSE)
- Shorter, high-intensity with limited rest
- Broken Speed durance efforts
- Less potential fatigue can be better tech execution
- Can serve as a bridge from maxV into longer speed-endurance reps
	- particularly in early competitive season
- ASSE (anaerobic short-speed) — 3 x 3x60m with 3 / 6min recovery
- GSSE (glycolytic short-speed) — 3 x 4x80m with 1.5 / 4min recovery
	- Can set paces off testing marks (30m fly), provide race-model opportunities with higher reps
### Parno’s Thoughts on Speed Endurance
- Capacity and Tech Proficiency before power/endurance
- Tech Model = Endurance
	- Producing and applying productive force thru the race
	- Preventing poor tech late in race
- Races are endurance work
	- Must factor early-season, esp. if racing 2x p/wk
	- Race/recover/race/recover vs race/wrokout/race/workout
- Where to progress to?
	- Prepping and priming for races
	- Schedule dependent
## Special Endurance
### What — High-Intensity focusing on glycolytic power and tolerance
- Two suggestions, I and II, Full-Recovery needed basedo ndistancaes
- Athletes need to deal with byproducts (hydrogen ions from Lactic-Acid)
### When — Late into specific prep
- Focus accel/speed deve  while buildijg aerobic/anaerobic thru temo work
- 1-2x p/wkj depending on meet shcedule
### How
- SP I — 250,, 200, 150 with 15min recovery
- SP II – Broken 400’s (300/100)
### Parno’s Thoughts on Special Endurance
- How much is enough
- Counting meets/races as SE
- Quality work versus the Death March
	- Different between a tough workout and a dump workout
	- Can always add rest to keep quality high
## Progressions of Sprint Training
- Accel
- Max-Velocity
- Speed Endurance
- Special Endurance
## Tempo (don’t turn away now)
### What — Varied intensity working addressing aerobic/anaerobic
- Wide range of prescribed, recoveries based off goal
### When — Starting point based off event
- Revert to recovery / regeneration during comp season
### How
- Extensive — 10x100mm on grass at 75% intensity
- Intensive — 6x200m at 80% with 2min recovery
### Parno’s Thoughts on Tempo
- Continuous — outside scope of sprints importance
- Temo thru seasson in some fashion
	- Main theme thru fall, m ore of recovery modality as intensities crescendo to comp
		- Circuits
### Progressions of Tempo
- Extensive — 60-80%
- Intensive — 80-90%
- Special Endurance — 90-100%
# Secondary Progressions
## Sprint Drills
Allow for rehearsal of sprint components, coordination, and overall flexibility and ROM
### When
All-year-round in warmups — progress in intensity within each session
- Teach and refine tech while diagnosing issues along the way
## Plyos and Multijumps
- Develop RSI and elastic abilities
- Force application and position of application
- SSC (CON, ISO, ECC)
- Progressive Building throughout the season
	- Ankle pops — in place jumps — short bounds — extended bounds — depth jumps — hurdle hops
- Progressions start small and less intense, and progress to more explosive over time
## MB and Multithrows
### MB
- General strength to improve awareness/coordination
- Lower-intesntiy, controlled, likely in a circuit
### Multithrows
- INtensive for power-develoipment (can be specific for performance, i.e. single-leg)
## General Strength
- Littel to no external load, use BW as main resistance
- Assist with general energy system improvement over time
- Throughout training year, can be added as warmup, post-workout, revoery, rehab
## Other training
### Flexibility
In warmup, sprint drills, dynamic movement, hurdle mobility
- Proper tech instrcution will psibitly affect flexibility
Statics can be approprised and used in limited quantities
Hurdle Mobility allows joints to work through large ROM while calling on balance and corrdination
# Coaching Philosophy
The single greatest impract on the athletes’s performance is your philosophy
- lens through which you see the world
- Prodound effect on training decisions
- Know the rules ebfore you bend the rules (training theory, apply and adjust)
- Nothing right or wrong, just rational and irrational
- Let it change over time as knowledge increases and athletes come in and out
- Parno: Success-Driven, Science-Backed
	- Athlete-coach relationship takes forefront for future success
# General Sequencing
- General to Specific
- SAimple to Complex
- Capacity to Power
- In-Place Jumps – -Baby Bounds – Speed Bounds
- Gen Sterngth – Power — Abs. STR — Reactive STR
# Compatible and Complimentary Training
Grouping by Training Demand
- If it’s a neuro day, it’s a neuro day — Components are going to be neuro-focused
- Daily Plans
	- Start with highest demand (accel before multi-throws, general strength before/after tempo)
