**

“7th & 8th grade athletes who would like to participate must meet a standard in order to join the high school program. **Athletes must be at practice the first three days in order to potentially qualify.**”
# Three Methods of Qualification:
There is outlined three ways that MS athletes can qualify for the upper-school team.
1. Existing Precedent
2. Pentathlon Tryouts
3. Existing T&F / XC Performance
## MS athletes on the HS team last season 
Any current **MS athletes who were on the HS track & field team last year do not have to meet any standards.** They are automatically welcomed back on the team.
## Pentathlon at First Week of HS Practice 
On the third day of practice, all HS track & field athletes will compete in a pentathlon event. **Any MS athlete can attend the first 3 days of practice and participate in the pentathlon.** 
MS athletes **have to meet one standard** in order to be eligible to stay out for the season.

| Event                  | Boys Standard   | Girls Standard |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Shot Put               | 25’0” + (12 lb) | 16’0” + (4kg)  |
| Standing Long Jump     | 6’6” +          | 5’9” +         |

## Track & Field or XC Standard
If any MS athlete has participated in T&F or XC events on their own, they may use those marks to potentially qualify for the HS team.
**If a MS athlete has met any of the below standards, they would be eligible** for the high school track & field team.

> [!INFO]- Advancement of Middle-School Athletes
> There are **two scenarios** in which a 7th or 8th grader may advance to participate in athletics at the high school level. Activities that are open or closed to 7th or 8th grade athletes are determined seasonally based on registration needs. 
> 
> Participants will be allowed to advance **if the following conditions are met:** 
> 	○ Tryouts are arranged so that all interested persons may tryout 
> 	○ The **advancement fills a specific position necessary to field a team** or offer the activity 
> 	○ The **advancement does not typically displace 9-12th grade students** from co-curricular activities 
> 	○ Parent/ Guardian approval is obtained 
> 
> **When participation is primarily for 9th-12th graders,** a 7th or 8th grade athlete may be considered as a possible participant at the **VARSITY level** in a given sport after meeting the following conditions: 
> 
> ○ The student and their family must fill out the **Exceptional Athlete Application** before the season’s tryouts. 
> 	Families must also communicate their intent to tryout with any Shakopee Youth Association being affected. 
> 	
> ○ Students would be encouraged to participate during Summer Waiver.
> 	 This would be a pre-tryout process where the **Athletic Director, school principals and the varsity coach must all agree** that the move would be beneficial to the student and be appropriate for the athlete’s **physical, psychological, social, and emotional readiness** for competition at the varsity level. 
> 
> ○ The student’s parent/guardian has been advised of both the pros and cons of permitting the student to play at the varsity level. 
> 
> ○ Middle School athletes who receive summer waiver approval for varsity participation shall undergo a **tryout period at the beginning of the high school season** in which the varsity coach evaluates their skill level. 
> 	This tryout shall be a minimum of two days and shall not exceed two weeks. 
> 	At the conclusion of the tryout, **the varsity coach will meet with the athlete** to discuss the anticipated role of the athlete for the season. 
> 	
> ○ Students must be registered, per MSHSL policy, for the sport before they can practice during the season
