# Liberty Track and Field: 7th / 8th Grade Advancement Standards
The LCA Varsity Track & Field program primarily serves high school athletes. Our middle school program emphasizes athlete development, but 7th and 8th grade athletes who demonstrate exceptional ability and readiness may qualify to train at the varsity level.
## 7th and 8th Grade Athletes may become eligible for advancement to the varsity level in one of three ways:
7th and 8th Grade athletes who were **existing members** of the Varsity Track & Field team in the prior season are automatically eligible to return with the varsity training group. **No additional standards need to be met.**

---

7th and 8th Grade athletes may qualify by participating in the **Track & Field Combine,** held during the first week of practice.
	*Athletes must attend both days of the combine in order to be considered.*
Athletes that meet **at least one of the performance standards** will become eligible for advancement.
