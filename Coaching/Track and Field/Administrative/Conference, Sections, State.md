## Conference: MCAA
New conference this year, tough competition expected. Big teams, usually co-ops, with strong talent. It’s going to be a rough transition, esp. after losing all our major seniors last year.
**Main Goal: Stay Positive.**
### Member-Schools (2024-25)
- **Mayer Lutheran:** well-rounded with a standout athlete in the sprints/jumps (J. Shimanski)
- **ERA:** likely the 2nd biggest # of athletes (next to Spectrum). Well-rounded, leans mid-distance and jumps.
- **NLA/LILA:** we’re familiar. Not usually a major contender by talent, but makes up the difference with size.
- **Legacy**: well-rounded, a solid threat and of good size. Dominates the women’s side though.
- **Parnassus**: Big, but not a major threat. Watching out for them in the mid-to-long, and high-jump.
- **West Lutheran:** the second deadliest addition. Huge, always crushes the distance events.
- **Spectrum:** the deadliest addition. Large talent pool, great depth, well-rounded.

## Sections
Losing a lot of our heavy-hitting seniors, still hoping to punch a relay group into the finals.
Individual competitors still stand a decent chance (**Levi** in the 400m, **Wurst** in the 800m/1600m), with some returning firepower as well (**William** in Long/Triple/High)

## State Meet
Two major state-hopefuls this year.
- **William Gilbert:** Long-Jump, Triple-Jump, High-Jump
	- Triple most likely
	- Could double with Long
	- High Jump not as likely, but still potential
- **Ben Wurst:** 800m, 1600m
	- Going to have better luck in the 800m, but could potentially double
