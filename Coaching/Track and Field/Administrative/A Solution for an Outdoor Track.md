# Proposed Solution — Gravel Track
**Summary:** suggestion is to install a gravel track-surface at the Hugo campus because we cannot install an outdoor track under our current permit. Installing a gravel track would be “better than nothing,” and would allow for practices to be held on a 400m oval on-site, rather than renting facility space at an external-track.
Unfortunately, this solution, in addition to being significant cost, would likely still leave the track team needing to rent space at an external track, as we would not be able to serve
- our jumpers (who need a non-slip surface to take off from)
- our throwers (who need an in-ground concrete pad, and the laying of concrete is not allowed without revision to the construction permit—the original reason a gravel track was suggested)
Additionally, the cost to install gravel is still significant, estimated at between $50k and $60k.
## What Needs are Being Met?
### Track-Team
- Competition-Length Oval — Visual Pacing for Distances and Race-Modeling
- Full-Length Straightaway — Drills Extending Beyond 30m
### Other Activities
- Gym-Class — Warmup-Laps, Testing the Mile
- Other Sports — Warmup Laps, Pre/Post-Practice Conditioning
- Offseason Distance Work — provide a place where athletes can train in the summer
## What Gaps Are Being Left?
### Track-Team
- Injurious Surface compared to Grass/Rubber — would not trust sprints on it
	- Less yielding than grass, less elastic than rubber — comparable to a concrete gym-floor
- (at High-Speeds) Low-Traction Surface compared to Grass/Rubber
	- would not trust high-effort starts or hurdling, as slip onto a sharp surface could lead to injury
	- would not trust high-jump takeoff, as slip with high forces and lateral momentum can lead to serious injury
	- would not trust long/triple jump takeoff, as slip with such high forces can lead to serious injury
- Does not account for throwers, who need an in-ground concrete pad
	- (the laying of concrete is not allowed without revision to the construction permit—the original reason a gravel track was suggested)
- Indoor Practicing — with Midwest-weather often leading to below-freezing temperatures in the early-season, this still leaves the team practicing indoors for a lot of the preparation-phase work
	- Would rather a temporary solution enhance our ability to start the season regardless of outdoor conditions
### Other Activities
- Minimal gaps left with other activities, as gym-class and other sports are likely to use at lower-speeds
	- Unlikely to run into the same issues that the track-team will with high-velocity and high-force groups
### Misc. Gaps
- Fundraising Momentum — unlikely to build as much momentum in fundraising if families/staff see a temporary solution
	- Less need because they see “a solution that works” visible on-site
- Pressure to Upgrade — similar to fundraising, this “temporary solution” is likely to remain for a significant period of time as “something that works,” even if not ideal
	- Would rather see pressure to do an install right the first time, with proper space-allocation and surfacing, rather than do again 5-8yrs down the line
## Cost Analysis
Construction of a gravel track involves three stages: materials purchase, installation, and maintenance.
Square footage depends on how many lanes you need. Broken out by total length of combined lanes,
- 4-Lane Track — 5390’ 5” x 48” lane-width = 21,562 sq-ft
- 6-Lane Track — 8,234’ 11” x 48” lane-width = 32,940 sq-ft
- 8-Lane Track — 11,181’ 1” x 48” lane-width = 44,724 sq-ft
- (Jumps Runway — 140’ x 48” lane-width = 560 sq-ft)
### Initial Setup

### Maintenance
# Ross’s Temp-Solution — Roll-Out Runway (Indoor Use)
**Summary:** suggestion is to, instead of a gravel track, purchase roll-out runway to be used in the double-wide gym or in hallways, and put away when not in use, in addition to maintaining our rental of an external track 2x p/wk during the season.
This solution, while not allowing for longer reps (beyond 30m), would still allow for the acceleration-development of sprinters, jumpers, and hurdlers. Distance athletes maintain their ability to develop outside, even if they don’t have a 400m oval to use for visual pacing. Race-modeling, in this instance, will be performed on days the team is at an external track.
## What Needs are Being Met?
### Track-Team
- Sprinters — can perform short accelerations (30m or less) in spikes
- Horizontal Jumpers — can perform acceleration work and dial in their approach with spikes, though cannot practice landing mechanics into sand. 
- High-Jumpers — can perform approach work and bar-takeoffs in flats if a high-jump mat is purchased, though cannot use spikes.
- Hurdlers — can perform accelerations in spikes, reps over 1 hurdle, or reps over 2 hurdles, effectively completing the needs we have for this groups’ practices.
### Other Activities
- Strength and Conditioning — during other sports-seasons, can use roll-out runway in hallways to allow for S&C programs to get sprint-development year-round, without interfering with other sports practicing in the gym.
## What Gaps Are Being Left?
### Track-Team
- Throwers — Still lacking an outdoor ring, though if an indoor ring is purchased, can practice in the large gym with indoor implements if a net is used to protect other athletes in the space
- Distance Athletes — cannot use a 400m oval for visual pacing and race-modeling, unless practices are held at an external facility. Can continue to develop outdoors using more cross-country style work.
- Horizontal Jumpers — cannot practice landing mechanics into a pit, though can emulate some of these technical components if jumping onto a high-jump mat indoors.
- Sprinters — cannot perform drills beyond 30m, which leaves lack of development in the transition and max-velocity phases, unless practices are held at an external facility.
### Other Activities
- Middle-School Track — constraining to the indoor space means greater difficulty in sharing space effectively. If 4 lanes of roll-out runway are purchased, can split to two-halves of the gym (long-ways), with two lanes for middle and two to upper, though this overlap is likely to lead to athlete-distraction unless logistics are handled correctly.
### Misc. Gaps
- Setup/Tear-Down Time — surface would need to be rolled out for practices, and put away when they are finished
## Cost Analysis
### Initial Purchase
In a double-wide gym (100ft of court, plus at least 3ft of out-of-bounds on each side of each court), we would be outfitting a lane that’s 112-130ft long. To accomodate our team, we would need a minimum of two lanes (one to perform reps in, one to walk back in so athletes don’t need to take their spikes off), but would prefer 3-4.
Multiple vendors sell rollout runways.

### Staging Strategy
- **Phase 1-2** can be completed independently and prepare the site for future work
- **Phase 3** (base construction) must be completed before Phase 4 (track surface)
- **Phase 4** represents the major milestone: a **usable track** once complete
- **Phase 5** (fencing) can be completed at any time, even after the track is operational
- Each phase can serve as a **natural stopping point** for staged construction or fundraising
### Future Considerations (Not Included in Base Estimate)
- Sports Lighting: $20,000 - $400,000
- Field Event Areas (jump pits, throwing circles, etc.): Additional cost
- Seating/Bleachers: Varies significantly
- Long-term maintenance: Regular upkeep required to ensure track longevity
### Hugo, MN Specific Considerations
- **Climate Adaptation:** Minnesota weather requires robust drainage and materials that withstand freeze-thaw cycles
- **Site Advantage:** Flat farmland reduces grading costs significantly compared to sloped or rocky terrain
- **Local Labor & Materials:** Access to Twin Cities metro area contractors and suppliers
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure adherence to Hugo, MN building codes and regulations
