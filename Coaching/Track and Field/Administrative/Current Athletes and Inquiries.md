# Dixon, Addy and Eloise
**Main Idea:** accessibility of application, but emphasize *speed & power*.
## Addy
**Biggest Goal:** *hypertrophy* and *power*-output, maintaining speed. 
**Specializations:** Hurdles and High-Jump.
- Needs: Vertical Jumping, Hip Mobility, Rate and Magnitude
- Constraints: Small-Space (sprinting only in fall)
- (Anticipated) Biggest Influence: [[Cheat Code]]
Program Link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/178U5Ht99mVuqpk5PTLkSXQ9ajcLTETQDtGTDhqIIXBc/edit?usp=sharing)
## Eloise
**Biggest Goal:** building love of athletic movement
**Specializations:** none (creating a generalist, lots of *GPP*)
- Needs: Speed, Strength, Capacity
- Constraints: low training-age
# Wurst, Jonah and Ben
**Main Idea:** flexibility of application (soccer season), working on *aerobic* engine/capacity, *anaerobic* outputs, maintaining some speed and some strength
**Specialization:** mid-to-long distance (800+)
- Biggest Influence: [[Steve Magness]], [[Joe Rubio]]
# Dobrotka, Lily
**Main Idea:** *hybrid*-training (prep for air-force PT exam)
**Specialization:** sprints
- Needs: 
- Constraints: need to keep long-runs in regularly, may pull back from speed-work
# Louis, Sophia (Inquiry)
**Main Idea:** accessibility of application, but emphasize *speed & power*.

**Specializations:** Jumps
- Needs: Speed, Strength, Capacity
- Constraints: low training-age
- Biggest Influence: [[J. Science_Bodyweight]]
# Sjobeck, Lauren
**Main Idea:** *Size, Strength, Power*
- Biggest Influence: [[1x20]]
# Gilbert, William
**Main Idea:** High-Low Model, emphasize flexibility. *Speed/Power* emphasis.
# Tolar, Eda
**Main Idea:** *Size, Strength, Power*
- Biggest Influence: [[Hypertrophy Clusters]]
