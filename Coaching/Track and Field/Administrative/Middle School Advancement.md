# Overview
Currently not a defined set of standards that both a) clearly spell out how MS Advancement works (the how, the when, the process), and b) apply clearly to the sport of track and field.
Prospective Standards are inspired from Shakopee Schools Standards to introduce pathways and criteria, as well as (in track’s case) specific performance-standards to meet to be considered for advancement.
# The Problem
1. There aren’t an **objective** set of standards to guide. Track is historically not a sport that implements subjective tryouts, which leaves this topic in a grey area for the purpose of advancement.
2. There aren’t **clear guidelines**  for what [[Middle-School Tryouts]] should look like for purpose of advancement:
	- *Discussions*: on what timeline? With who involved?
		- Is it a majority, a consensus, etc.? Who has final say?
	- *Tryouts*: required to host on any given days? — (Accessibility Requirements)
		- Coaches Handbook — “may take up to two days,” “determined by AD//Asst. AD”
	- *Tryouts*: required metrics to hold up against? — (hopefully what the standards address)
		- Largest gap for track, as we are a metrics-driven sport: no “team-skills” to evaluate, need to rely not on evaluator-opinion, but rather performance in KPIs.
## Current Descriptions:
*(as cited from Jaimi’s 05-29-2025 Email)*
“We have school policies set in place to **keep our middle-schoolers at the middle-school level.**”
“We allow athletes **to move up one grade level** if they qualify and are beyond ready to compete against other juniors/seniors. This will be determined by our **MS/Varsity coach and our athletic directors.**”
“It should be extremely difficult even at the 8th grade level to move up to a JV/Varsity team.”

*(as cited from the Coaches Handbook, pg. 8)*
“Middle school players will try out for middle school teams. After this tryout, a 7th or 8th grade player may be **invited to an additional tryout** for the high-school team if the coaches and athletic director agree…Parent approval is required for a 7th or 8th grade student to attend this additional tryout.”

## High-Level Summary
**Every school, regardless of size or class, has a clear written stance** on MS athletes competing with varsity, though the level of formality varies.
	*Shakopee* is extremely detailed, with multiple advancement pathways and clear standards
	*St. Croix Prep* and Nova are simple/open, leaving the choice “solely” to the coach,
	*Wayzata* is performance-based, 
	*Minneapolis North/TCA/St. Agnes* are permissive but coach-driven.
## Comparing Key Traits
### Baseline Eligibility:
Under MSHSL rules, all 7th–8th graders are permitted to participate with the proper paperwork.
- _Nova, TCA, MSA, St. Croix Prep, St. Agnes, Minneapolis North, Wayzata_ — all 7th/8th graders can compete, with sport-specific discretion.
- _Shakopee_ — adds “exceptional athlete” form with AD/coach approval.
### Coach Discretion / Tryout Process
- _Shakopee_ — structured tryouts or performance standards (pentathlon, prior season precedent).
- _Wayzata_ — performance in practice/competition determines placement (very fluid).
- _MSA/Nova/TCA/St. Agnes_ — coaches are the sole authority deciding team membership.
	- All four schools have an identical quotation in their respective handbooks: **“Choosing the members of teams is solely the responsibility of the coaches.”**
### Administrative Oversight
- _Shakopee_ — paperwork required; AD + principal + coach all must agree.
- _Minneapolis North_ — no explicit oversight, MS athletes can “play up” if they have “the requisite interest, skills and abilities.”
- _Nova/St. Croix Prep/St. Agnes/TCA/MSA_ — minimal AD involvement, primarily coach-driven.
### Equity Considerations
- _Shakopee_ explicitly avoids displacing 9–12th athletes, MS are to be considered out of team necessity (fielding a team or filling a specific role).
	- *St. Agnes* writes similar language about preferring 9th-12th on teams, but they also had one of the largest MS numbers on their JV/Varsity track team, so there are clearly sport-specific guidelines to this.
- _Other schools_ don’t mention displacement but emphasize inclusivity and fairness (coaches taking as many as is reasonable to field a quality team)
### **Track & Field-Specific Examples**
- _Shakopee_ — If not grandfathered, MS athletes may qualify via pentathlon or prior XC/T&F marks. Must attend first 3 practices where they are evaluated.
- _Wayzata_ — assignments based on competitive readiness, MS/US lumped into one body and separated after the fact.
- _St. Croix Prep, Nova_ — similar to Wayzata. Single unified team, then grouped by ability.

# Proposed Policy Key-Reference: Shakopee Ideology
## General Conditions for Advancement
A middle school student-athlete (7th or 8th grade) may advance to the high school level if **all** of the following criteria are met:
1. **Open Tryouts:** Tryouts must be arranged so that all interested athletes may participate.
2. **Team Necessity:** Advancement is required to fill a specific position necessary to field a team or offer the activity.
3. **No Displacement:** Advancement does not displace students in grades 9–12 from participating in the activity.
4. **Parental Approval:** Parent/guardian consent must be obtained.
## Advancement for Varsity-Level Participation
When a sport is primarily intended for grades 9–12, middle school athletes may be considered for varsity-level participation under the following conditions:
1. **Communication of Intent:**
    - The student and their family must complete an _Advancement Request Form_ (provided by the Athletic Department) prior to tryouts.
    - Families should also notify any affiliated youth association of their intent to try out.
2. **Pre-Season Evaluation:**
    - The Athletic Director, school principals, and the varsity coach must jointly agree that advancement would be beneficial and appropriate based on the student’s physical, psychological, social, and emotional readiness.
    - When available, this may occur during summer waiver activities; if no such activities are offered, a separate evaluation will be arranged before the start of tryouts.
3. **Parental Advisement:**
    - Parents/guardians must be advised of both the potential benefits and drawbacks of varsity participation.
4. **Tryout Period:**
    - Approved middle school athletes must undergo a tryout period at the start of the season.
    - This period must last a minimum of two (2) days and no longer than two (2) weeks.
    - At the conclusion, the varsity coach will meet with the athlete to discuss the athlete’s anticipated role for the season.
5. **Registration Requirement:**
    - Students must be formally registered, in accordance with MSHSL policy, before practicing or competing.
