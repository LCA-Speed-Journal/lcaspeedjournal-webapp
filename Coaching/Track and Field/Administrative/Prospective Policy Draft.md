# **Middle School Advancement Policy**
# Purpose
The Liberty Classical Track & Field program is a high school (grades 9–12) team.
While middle school athletics are designed for development, opportunities exist for **7th and 8th grade athletes who demonstrate exceptional ability and readiness to compete at the varsity level**.
The purpose of this policy is to:
- Provide clear and fair standards for advancement.
- Ensure the integrity of the high school program.
- Support the physical, psychological, and social readiness of student-athletes.

Middle school athletes may become **eligible for advancement to the varsity level** in one of three ways:
1. **Precedent** – Returning Members
2. **Combine Testing** – Early-Season Evaluation
3. **Official Performance Standards** – Verified Results from Prior Competition
