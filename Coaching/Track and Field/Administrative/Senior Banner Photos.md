# 2024-25 Reflections:
## What Went Well
- Seniors had a great time messing around both beforehand, as well as with poses
	- More collaborative experience went over well
## What Didn’t Go Well
- Setup: Need more Time to get things figured out
	- Should be less of an issue this year, need to **prep pieces in advance** so transport is easier
- Some seniors **over-pumped** for photo, leaving shine on faces rather than added pump
- Transitioning between **black vs white backgrounds**
	- Idea: Set up one side Black, One-Side White, **camera** is the thing that moves
