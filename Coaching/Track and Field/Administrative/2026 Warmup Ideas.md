# 2025-State
Our Current-State: 
Warmup → CNS-Priming → (Main Work)
## Warmup
Generally used for more general things.
- Mobility-Work and Movement Prep:
	- *[[Dynamic Hip Sequence]]* (as per [[David Grey]])
- ISO-Holds: Three Categories
	- Long Yielding — *SL-Stand, ISO-Lunge*
		- More for an analgesic effect (per [[Jumpers Knee Protocol]] + [[Jake Tuura]]’s tendon research)
	- Medium, Force-Capacity — *fRoller Bridge,* 
	- Short, OVC — (didn’t use much)
		- More for Potentiation (per [[Jake Tuura]], + [[Alex Natera]] and his [[RSIST]]-Methods)
- Dynamic Warmup things:
	- Movement Exploration — crawls, crouches, rolls (see [[Joel Smith]] and [[+Elastic Essentials]])
Can be used for things like small-sided games or other “neural-driven” warmups as well.
## CNS-Priming 
Generally used for more workout-specific warmups (hitting the AMP of RAMP).
- [[Extensive-Rapid-Strides]] (as per [[Lachen Reid]] in [[Racehorse 2]])
- [[Light, Medium, Deep-Tier Plyos]] (as per [[Matt Mcinnes Watson]])
- [[10-in-10]] (as per [[Tony Holler]])

# 2026-State — Planned Updates
Planned State: 
Mobility/Prehab → Movement Prep → Speed Drills and Priming → (Main Work)

> [!TIP] Small-Sided Games First?
> In this scenario, we are effectively skipping Mobility/Prehab. It’s a graded exposure, since the game is self-limiting, so overall not a concern. If really needed, can do after.
> Basically just rolls Movement-Prep into Speed Drills & Priming. A combo-activity.
## Mobility / Prehab
(see also: [[(CSAC-5) Programming Speed & Agility#Prehab|Spellman Prehab]], [[David Grey]]) – Can make this full-team, or allow for more individualized work

| Area / Focus | Exercise(s)                 | Why / Impact                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hip          | [[Dynamic Hip Sequence]]    | Most important besides the foot. Locked up here can mean lots of problems downstream once we get moving                                       |
| Foot / Ankle | [[Foot and Achilles Rehab]] | Bring awareness into the feet<br>Ensure proper foot-ankle interaction **before** we start moving                                              |
| Spine        | T-Spine Mobility            | Unlock more Rotation                                                                                                                          |
| Spine        | Cross-Crawl                 | Make sure our oblique-slings are connecting, and we have mobility in the spine (tilting L/R, flexing/extending, and connecting to gait-cycle) |
| Upper        | [[Upper Body Basics]]       |                                                                                                                                               |
### Hurdle Mobility
Can help not just hurdlers, but the whole team — ensure we’re using comp hurdles so people don’t tip them over
- Wall Drills — Lead, Trail
- Walkovers — Lead, Trail, Over-the-Top
- Over-Unders
## Movement Prep / Neuro
(see also: [[(CSAC-5) Programming Speed & Agility#Movement Prep (can be additional, but good prehab can cover this)|Spellman Movement Prep]], [[Neuro Warmup]], [[Dan Fichter]]))
#### Banded-Work — Menu
- Ground-Series: Hip-Thrust, SL Hip-Thrust, Clamshell

- Dynamic Stretches: high-knee pulls, straight-leg kicks, lunge and reach
- Backwards Series: walking, skipping, running, anything we can think of. 
	- Halfway neural + HR-Raising
### Neuro Things — Menu
- Pogos, things working quick SSC
- Frequency-drills: fast-switching, turnover
- Plyos or other “Fast GCT” work: particularly with in-air repositioning
## Speed Drills
