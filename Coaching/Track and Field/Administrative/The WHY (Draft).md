# The WHY for LCA's Track and Field Program
## Purpose: Inspiration and Growth through Track and Field
The core purpose of our program is **to inspire young athletes to grow not only as competitors but also as individuals.**
We aim to:
- build character, 
- foster resilience, and 
- cultivate teamwork, 
setting the foundation for success in athletics and life.
## Belief: Unlocking Potential in All Athletes thru Sport
We believe that every athlete has untapped potential, and our program exists to help them discover and develop it.
Track and field is more than a competition; it is a vehicle for teaching discipline, goal-setting, and perseverance.
We create an environment where every athlete feels valued, supported, and challenged to excel.
## Vision: Empowering Tomorrow’s Leaders
|Our vision is to create a program that empowers student-athletes to embrace challenges, celebrate progress, and carry the lessons they learn on the track into every area of their lives.
We aim to develop leaders who inspire others, make meaningful contributions to their communities, and uphold the values of integrity, hard work, and sportsmanship.
## WHY: The Heart of Our Program
Our program is dedicated to achieving excellence on and off the track, striving to provide a supportive yet competitive environment for all athletes.
We focus on:
#### Tracking Metrics and Performance: 
Identifying areas for growth and encouraging continuous improvement.
#### Motivating Through Empowerment:
Helping athletes understand the feeling of success, even in practice.
#### Emphasizing Speed and Power:
Creating well-rounded athletes who excel across events.
## Core Principles
We believe in core principles that define our approach:
- Speed is the Tide That Lifts All Boats
- 100% Fit Does Not Beat 100% Healthy
- When in Doubt, Show Up and Try
- Act as an Individual, Represent Our Community
- No Shortcuts to True Excellence
## HOW: Living Our WHY
### Purposeful Training:  
We design practices to be effective, inclusive, and adaptable to diverse skill levels.
### Supportive Environment: 
Our coaching emphasizes encouragement, constructive feedback, and open communication.
### Holistic Approach: 
We address physical conditioning, mental toughness, and emotional well-being.
## WHAT: Tangible Outcomes
- Comprehensive training programs tailored to individual and team goals.
- Competitive opportunities that challenge athletes to reach new heights.
- Regular feedback and evaluations to celebrate achievements and identify areas for improvement. 
- Strong partnerships with parents and the school community to ensure a unified approach to success.
By starting with our WHY, we ensure that every decision, practice, and competition aligns with our mission to inspire and empower student-athletes.
This clarity guides our communication with stakeholders and sets us apart as a program that prioritizes long-term impact over short-term results.
## Stakeholder Communication Plan
When engaging with stakeholders, focus on key themes that embody the essence of our program while being concise and impactful. 
Highlight these core ideas:
#### Purpose-Driven Program:  
"Our mission is to inspire growth; building character, resilience, and teamwork for success both on and off the track."
#### Development of Potential: 
Every athlete has untapped potential, and we’re here to help them discover it through discipline, goal-setting, and perseverance
#### Commitment to Excellence: 
“We emphasize a supportive yet competitive environment where every athlete can excel."
#### Core Values:
“We uphold principles like community representation, health over fitness, showing up even in doubt, and striving for true excellence."
### Long-Term Impact:

These key messages can be woven into conversations to align stakeholders with our mission and vision effectively.
## Idea Points for Hagstrom Talk
When discussing team expansion to include homeschool participation, emphasize the following points:
#### Enhanced Opportunities for All:
Including homeschool athletes would broaden our community reach and provide opportunities for current athletes to compete in events that have previously gone unfilled, strengthening team depth and dynamics.
#### No Zero-Sum Concerns
Track doesn't compete for play-time in the same way as other sports. Participation from homeschool athletes won’t displace current student-athletes but will enhance competition and team performance.
#### Community Integration with Faith at the Center: 
By welcoming homeschool athletes, we reflect the Christian mission of inclusivity and service to others. This expansion exemplifies Christ-like principles of fellowship, support, and nurturing talent for the greater good.
#### Mutual Benefits:
Expanding the team increases our visibility and credibility as a program while offering more students—both enrolled and homeschooled—a chance to grow and succeed through athletics.
Address concerns directly by clarifying that track’s structure allows for inclusive participation, making it a win-win for everyone involved.
