# Email to Athletic Department — Communication Framework

**Subject: Follow-up: Middle School Advancement Policy Communication

Dave,

Following up on our conversation last Monday regarding the planned communication for the middle school advancement policy updates, as I have not heard any updates. 
If the department is still committed to opening spring signups next week, this communication needs to go out soon so families have time to review the changes and process the information before signups formally open.

If there is currently no draft, I’ve attached a communication framework that's ready to use—whether you want to revise with different language or use it as-is to simply get the communication out.

**The framework includes:**
- Introduction of the two new qualification methods (Prior Competition Results and Track & Field Combine)
- Emphasis on the policy change giving families decision-making authority for training group placement
- Reference to the full policy document for complete details
- Information about two Q&A opportunities (the planned open-Q&A session, and coming to see us at parent-teacher conferences)

It's written from the athletic department's perspective and addresses all 7th and 8th grade families, as going out more broadly will inform new families.

The full policy document is also attached, as it should be linked to the communication for parents to reference the complete handout if they need clarification.

Let me know what else I can do to get this finalized and sent out on time.

Thanks,
