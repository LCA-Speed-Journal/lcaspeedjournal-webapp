## Pros & Cons Summary
### Roll-Out Runway
**Pros:**
- ✅ Low cost ($3.5K-$5.8K for 3 lanes)
- ✅ Safe surface for short accelerations (30m or less) in spikes
- ✅ Works for sprinters, jumpers (acceleration), hurdlers
- ✅ Indoor use - year-round availability regardless of weather
- ✅ Can be used in hallways for S&C during other sports seasons
- ✅ No permits required
- ✅ Portable - can be stored when not in use
**Cons:**
- ❌ Limited to 30m runs (cannot develop transition/max-velocity phases)
- ❌ No 400m oval (distance athletes cannot use for visual pacing)
- ❌ No race-modeling on-site (requires external track rental)
- ❌ No pit landings for horizontal jumpers
- ❌ High-jump limited (flats only, no spikes)
- ❌ Throwers need separate indoor ring setup
- ❌ Setup/tear-down time required per practice
- ❌ Space-sharing challenges for middle-school track
- ❌ Cannot serve gym class or other sports (indoor only)
### Gravel Track
**Pros:**
- ✅ Full 400m competition-length oval
- ✅ Visual pacing for distances and race-modeling
- ✅ Full-length straightaway for drills beyond 30m
- ✅ Lower cost ($50K-$60K) compared to permanent track
- ✅ On-site availability
- ✅ Serves gym class and other sports
**Cons:**
- ❌ Injurious surface (comparable to concrete) - unsafe for sprints
- ❌ Low-traction surface - unsafe for starts, hurdles, jumps
- ❌ Cannot serve jumpers (dangerous takeoff surface)
- ❌ Cannot serve throwers (concrete pads not permitted under current permit)
- ❌ Early-season weather limitations (team still practices indoors)
- ❌ May reduce fundraising momentum (seen as "temporary solution")
- ❌ May remain as permanent temporary solution, delaying proper track
### Polyurethane Track-Surface
**Pros:**
- ✅ Full 400m competition-length oval
- ✅ Visual pacing for distances and race-modeling
- ✅ Full-length straightaway for all drills
- ✅ Safe, high-traction surface for all events (sprints, jumps, throws)
- ✅ Competition-ready surface
- ✅ Accommodates all field events (jumps, throws with proper installation)
- ✅ Permanent facility - serves community needs
- ✅ Can be staged/fundraised in phases
	- ($15K, $200K, $500K, $1.1M milestones)
- ✅ Usable track available at $1.1M milestone (fencing can come later)
- ✅ Long-term solution - proper installation the first time
**Cons:**
- ❌ High initial cost
	- ($775K-$1.3M base, $853K-$1.4M with contingency)
- ❌ Multiple-phase construction timeline (extended period)
- ❌ Permits required ($5K-$15K)
- ⚠️ Early-season weather may still limit use (Minnesota climate)
- ⚠️ Field event areas require additional costs (not in base estimate)
## Best Use Cases

| Solution               | Best For                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roll-Out Runway**    | Short-term solution for indoor sprint/acceleration work while maintaining external track rental for full training needs; S&C year-round use |
| **Gravel Track**       | Budget-constrained projects that need a 400m oval for basic distance training, but cannot accommodate high-speed or field event training    |
| **Polyurethane Track** | Long-term permanent solution for full competition and training needs; proper facility for hosting meets; community asset                    |
## Recommendation Summary
- **Gravel Track:** Not recommended due to safety concerns for high-speed and field events, despite lower cost
- **Roll-Out Runway:** Good temporary solution for indoor acceleration work, but team will still need external track rental for full training needs
- **Polyurethane Track:** Recommended long-term solution - addresses all needs, can be staged/fundraised in phases, provides competition-ready permanent facility
