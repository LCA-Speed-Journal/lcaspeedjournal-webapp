## Purpose:
Reframing objectives to the initiative as the “logical conclusion” of the rebuttals, but framed from a lens that shows their root-level misalignment with values system or key objectives.

### Differences in the Detail of Practice Structure

- Reframe B — Lack of Trust in middle-school athletes to integrate with defined structure
### Coach Assessment of Readiness
