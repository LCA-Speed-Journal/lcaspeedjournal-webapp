7th and 8th Grade Families,

We are writing to share important updates to our middle school Track & Field advancement policy for the upcoming season. Whether your student is new to Track & Field or has previous experience, these changes provide new pathways for 7th and 8th grade athletes to qualify for varsity-level training and give families greater input in training group placement decisions.

**What's New:**
We are adding **two new methods** for middle school athletes to qualify for advancement to varsity-level training:
1. **Prior Competition Results**: Athletes may submit official documentation from previous Track & Field or Cross-Country competitions (middle school meets, youth programs, or community races). Meeting one or more event standards qualifies them for advancement.
2. **Track & Field Combine**: For athletes who did not have a mark from last season or were not on the middle school team last year, the varsity team will hold a Track & Field Combine (30m sprint, vertical jump, broad jump, overhead med-ball throw, and 800m run) during the first week of practice. Athletes must meet at least one performance standard to qualify for advancement.
*Note: Existing policy for returning varsity members remains unchanged.*

**Key Policy Change:**
**Most importantly, families now have the choice** in training group placement for the track teams. When an athlete meets the advancement criteria, **you and your athlete will decide** which practice group (middle school or varsity) is the best fit. This decision-making authority has been moved from athletic directors and coaches to families, recognizing that you know the needs of your athlete.

**Full Policy Details**: For complete information including all specific performance standards and event requirements, please review the full policy document [link to full policy].

**Opportunities to Ask Questions:**
We understand you may have questions about these policy updates and how they might apply to your athlete. There will be two opportunities to speak with varsity coaches before signups close:
1. **Parent-Teacher Conferences**: Varsity coaches will be present at parent-teacher conferences to answer questions in advance of the spring season.
2. **Open Q&A Session**: The varsity head coach will hold an open Q&A session after school in the coming weeks to discuss what 7th and 8th grade families should know about advancing to the varsity team. Additional details about this session will be shared separately.

If you have questions before these opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to the athletic department.
