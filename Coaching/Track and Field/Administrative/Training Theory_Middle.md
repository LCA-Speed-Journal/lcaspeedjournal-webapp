## Sprinters and Jumpers
The most "hands-on" group, and on the bigger end for numbers. 65% of meet events are in this camp.
#### Traits
They tend to be an excitable bunch, which is a double edged sword. 
- Some may have difficulty focusing on longer or sustained tasks, but a lot in that bucket do well when things are varied or the intensity is more "burst-like," with high effort followed by longer rest.
- If you can make their activities fun, competitive, or like a game, they'll buy in and try hard without much effort. 
#### Training
If you do nothing else other than make sure they sprint/jump at max-effort 2-3x p/wk, they'll see a ton of development over the season. 
- Don't need to worry about doing a ton of technique drills, researching a bunch of form so you can talk them through, etc. 
- The vast majority simply need exposure to consistent sprinting/jumping in various ways, and the form will gradually work itself out as they keep practicing.
The one thing that is very important for this group is doing **95% of their reps "feeling fresh."** 
	They will not develop nearly as well when they're doing a bunch of bonus running (to warmup, cooldown, etc), doing reps when worn out from the previous practice, doing reps on too little rest, or simply doing too many reps in a practice. 
If they have one hard workout (our Lactic Days) p/wk, and the rest is just low-volume, high-effort sprints/jumps? That's perfect.
## Distance Athletes
Relatively easy to program. They benefit the most from simply getting used to running consistently. Most practices, can get away with just sending them off on a training run partway through the Priming, or after it finishes.
	They'll come back after sprints finish up, and accessories can be done as a whole team. They'll do Lactic Days together with the sprinters for their speed-endurance, so they just need to get more easy volume with the training runs.
#### Training Components:
Training Runs: 20-30mins or so
	Warmup with 10mins easy, then over the next 10-20mins, fit in 3-5 strides or "surges[^1]" 
	This gap can be as short as a minute, but as long as they fit all the reps in, it's simply as they feel ready.
#### Where to Start the Surges? 
Start the season with 20mins (10min warmup, 10mins for the strides). 
Strides = 3x20s (3 Reps, 20s each, about one every 2.5mins) at an easy, but "brisk" pace. 
Progress the strides (once every 2-3 workouts) by either 
	a) making the pace a little faster, or 
	b) adding a rep. 
## Throwers
Throwers are special case, because there is truly a good amount of technique to do the events safely. 
	If you don't have someone to coach them for throws-specific work, may be best avoiding this group entirely. Not a group that can safely "run itself" until they get to the high-school level (and even then it's sketchy).
If you end up finding help to supervise throws, but only for a specific dates, that's totally fine — just make sure they've got that "throws clinic" before the subsequent meet (if that means they only throw at 1-2 meets, that's also fine).

[^1]: These will be 15-30s of a faster pace, before settling back to the easy pace for a bit, then doing another rep and repeating.
