| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equipment & Additional Costs       | **Track Markings/Lanes**              | How are lanes marked on gravel?                                                          | Spraypaint lines, much like they would be on a field.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Equipment & Additional Costs       | **Starting Blocks**                   | Can starting blocks be used on gravel surface?                                           | Starting blocks can be used if anchored securely into the ground, though athletes likely wouldn’t risk using spikes due to the gravel wearing down the points, so these would be starts in flats.                                           |
| Equipment & Additional Costs       | **Field Event Equipment**             | Does installation include space/consideration for field event areas?                     | Install would leave room for a soccer field in the middle of the area, but would not consider throwing rings. There is potential for a jumps runway and a sand-pit to be constructed adjacent to the track.                                 |
| Facility Integration               | **Drainage Infrastructure**           | Does installation require additional drainage work?                                      | Install won’t require additional work, as the surface is pervious to water.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Facility Integration               | **Accessibility**                     | Will the track be accessible to all students/staff, including those with mobility needs? | Track will be accessible to all students/staff.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Facility Integration               | **Parking/Vehicle Access**            | Will track installation affect existing parking or vehicle access patterns?              | Gravel track will be placed in a field adjacent to main building, with a path to the area.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Facility Integration               | **Lighting**                          | Is there adequate lighting for early morning/evening use?                                | No additional lighting would be installed in this phase, though portable lights could be brought out.                                                                                                                                       |
| Facility Integration               | **Perimeter Safety**                  | Are there fencing or safety barriers needed?                                             | Fencing will be placed to roughly enclose the track.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Facility Integration               | **Integration with Other Facilities** | How does it interact with existing athletic facilities?                                  | As this building is an ongoing construction project, there are no current facilities. It will serve as an additional amenity in conjunction with the two-court gym and the weight-room.                                                     |
| Maintenance & Longevity            | **Ongoing Maintenance**               | What regular maintenance is required (grading, leveling, resurfacing)?                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Maintenance & Longevity            | **Material Replacement**              | How often does gravel need to be replaced or supplemented?                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Program Development Considerations | **Competition Preparation**           | How well does each solution prepare athletes for actual competition conditions?          | Gravel teaches race-modeling over the proper distances and shapes on the 400m oval, but on an inferior surface without spikes. Roll-out runway allows for sprint-spike usage, but does not allow for race-modeling on the proper distances. |
| Program Development Considerations | **Skill Transfer**                    | How does training on these surfaces transfer to competition performance?                 | Gravel teaches                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Program Development Considerations | **Athlete Buy-In**                    | How do athletes perceive these solutions? Will they be motivated by them?                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Program Development Considerations | **Recruitment Impact**                | How do these solutions affect program recruitment and retention?                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Training Philosophy & Methodology  | **Periodization Impact**              | How do limitations affect training periodization and peak performance timing?            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Training Philosophy & Methodology  | **Event-Specific Needs**              | Are there event-specific training needs not addressed by either solution?                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Training Philosophy & Methodology  | **Youth Development**                 | How do solutions affect long-term athlete development pathways?                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Training Philosophy & Methodology  | **Technical Development**             | How well can technical skills be developed on these surfaces vs. competition surfaces?   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Weather & Seasonal Factors         | **Drainage**                          | How will gravel track handle rain/snow? Will it become muddy or frozen?                  | Freezing is likely if moisture is present, leading to additional safety concerns.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Weather & Seasonal Factors         | **Seasonal Availability**             | How many days/year will it be usable given Midwest weather?                              | An unanswerable question — season-dependent, much like a real track surface would be                                                                                                                                                        |
| Weather & Seasonal Factors         | **Maintenance in Weather**            | Will gravel require regrading, leveling, or resurfacing after weather events?            | Leveling is potentially a concern — the surface is likely to migrate from its spot, so for sure would need a rake to keep clean.                                                                                                            |
| Weather & Seasonal Factors         | **Surface Consistency**               | How will gravel maintain consistent surface quality over time and weather cycles?        | Gravel would be fairly consistent over time, though it may break up and lose additional traction                                                                                                                                            |

| Equipment & Additional Costs       | **Hurdles**                   | Are hurdles compatible with roll-out runway surface?                                                      | Yes, hurdles are compatible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Equipment & Additional Costs       | **Starting Blocks**           | Can starting blocks be used on roll-out runway?                                                           | Yes, starting blocks can be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Equipment & Additional Costs       | **Wear & Tear**               | What is the expected lifespan, and what replacement costs should be anticipated?                          | Roll-out runway will last for at least 4-6years without replacement or maintenance costs, and in instances of damage, can be replaced as a piece rather than a whole lane (as 2 pieces make up a full lane)                                                                   |
| Equipment & Additional Costs       | **Multiple Units**            | How many units are needed to meet demand? (4 lanes mentioned for middle school)                           | Rolls come up to 100ft in length. We would be outfitting a 120ft lane, so would opt for 2 pieces (60ft p/ea) for each lane. Minimum lanes would be 2, preferred would be 3, with an added 2 rolls if MS is sharing space (this is currently unknown)                          |
| Equipment & Additional Costs       | **High-Jump Mat**             | Cost and storage of high-jump mat for horizontal jumpers                                                  | This cost is factored into both solutions. Storage is manageable if a foldable mat is purchased, this is up to the athletic department.                                                                                                                                       |
| Equipment & Additional Costs       | **Indoor Throwing Equipment** | Cost of indoor ring, net, and indoor implements                                                           | This cost is factored into both solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Facility Integration               | **Storage Conditions**        | What storage space is required?                                                                           | Rolls would be stored upright. Depending on how many rolls are purchased, this could be stored in an athletic closet or in another area near to the gym.                                                                                                                      |
| Facility Integration               | **Gym Scheduling**            | How will roll-out runway affect existing gym scheduling and availability?                                 | During spring-season, when track practices, the other sports teams are MS track and baseball. Baseball will likely practice outdoors.<br>During other seasons, we would not use this in the gym, instead this would be used in conjunction with S&C programs in the hallways. |
| Facility Integration               | **Hallway Usage**             | What are the safety/liability concerns of using hallways for sprint work?                                 | Sprinting in hallways is done by many programs with space-limitations, it is safe so long as proper signage warns participants that there are sprinters in the halls.                                                                                                         |
| Facility Integration               | **Noise Impact**              | Will indoor sprint work create noise disruptions to other classes/activities?                             | All activities will be done after school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Facility Integration               | **Floor Protection**          | Does the gym floor require protection beyond the runway?                                                  | No additional protection is required, so long as spikes stay on the runway and are taken off when coming back onto the gym floor.                                                                                                                                             |
| Maintenance & Longevity            | **Cleaning Requirements**     | What cleaning is needed between uses?                                                                     | Runway can be maintained using cleaning solutions and a mop to ensure dust does not collect on the surface.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Maintenance & Longevity            | **Damage Repair**             | What happens if runway is damaged? Can it be repaired?                                                    | Runway cannot be repaired. Small gouges and scrapes are acceptable, but if large holes form, the piece will need to be replaced.                                                                                                                                              |
| Maintenance & Longevity            | **Storage Damage**            | Risk of damage during storage (mold, crushing, etc.)                                                      | No risk of damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Program Development Considerations | **Competition Preparation**   | How well does each solution prepare athletes for actual competition conditions?                           | Gravel teaches race-modeling over the proper distances and shapes on the 400m oval, but on an inferior surface without spikes. Roll-out runway allows for sprint-spike usage, but does not allow for race-modeling on the proper distances.                                   |
| Program Development Considerations | **Skill Transfer**            | How does training on these surfaces transfer to competition performance?                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Program Development Considerations | **Athlete Buy-In**            | How do athletes perceive these solutions? Will they be motivated by them?                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Program Development Considerations | **Recruitment Impact**        | How do these solutions affect program recruitment and retention?                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Safety & Liability                 | **Indoor Safety**             | Are there concerns with athletes in spikes indoors, even on runway?                                       | Athletes will need to remove spikes when exiting the runway, but if they abide by those rules, there are no additional concerns.                                                                                                                                              |

### Key Financial Observations
**Gravel Track:**
- Significant upfront investment: $293,125-$314,063 total (materials + labor)
- Labor costs represent ~83% of total initial investment ($251,250 of $302,394 average)
- Cost scaleable by lane count: 4-lane tracks reduce materials cost by ~34%, 8-lane tracks increase by ~35%
- Permanent installation with ongoing maintenance requirements
- Estimated at $50-60k in original proposal; detailed analysis shows total costs significantly higher due to labor
**Roll-Out Runway:**
- Lower initial investment: $3,474-$4,551 for 3 lanes (36"-48" wide)
- No installation labor required (setup/tear-down by existing staff)
- Cost scaleable by number of lanes (add ~$906-$1,920 per additional 120ft lane)
- Portable solution with 4-6 year lifespan before replacement needed
- Additional equipment costs may apply (high-jump mat, indoor throwing ring/net)
### Cost-Benefit Considerations
**Gravel Track:**
- Higher initial cost but serves broader school community (gym class, other sports)
- Permanent facility available for offseason training
- Requires ongoing maintenance (leveling, material replacement)
- Still requires external facility rental for jumpers/throwers (permit constraints)
**Roll-Out Runway:**
- Lower initial cost (~1.1-1.5% of gravel track investment)
- No maintenance costs for 4-6 years
- Requires daily setup/tear-down time investment
- Flexible deployment (gym or hallways) enables year-round S&C use
- Limited to 30m length; external track rental still needed for max-velocity work and race modeling
### Cost Summary
The gravel track represents a substantially larger financial investment ($302,394 average total) compared to roll-out runway ($3,474-$4,551), with labor costs accounting for the majority of the expense. The roll-out runway solution provides a lower-cost temporary option that is approximately **1-1.5% of the gravel track investment**, though both solutions still require external facility rental to fully meet team needs.

### Critical Gaps in Both Solutions
- **Neither fully addresses throwers** (permit constraint for gravel; requires additional equipment for runway)
- **Neither fully addresses jumpers** (safety for gravel; landing pit for runway)
- **Neither fully addresses distance athlete pacing** (gravel has oval but safety concerns; runway has no oval)
- **Both maintain dependency on external facilities** (gravel for jumpers/throwers; runway for max-velocity and full event practice)
## Recommendations for Further Consideration
1. **Clarify operational logistics** for both solutions (scheduling, storage, maintenance procedures)
2. **Quantify weather impact** on gravel track usability (days/year analysis)
3. **Define equipment package** for roll-out runway (including all required accessories)
4. **Assess space-sharing solutions** for roll-out runway (middle school coordination)
5. **Evaluate fundraising impact** of roll-out runway as temporary solution
6. **Consider hybrid approaches** that might combine elements of both solutions
7. **Document external facility dependency** clearly for decision-makers
8. **Compare actual training days available** between solutions (gravel weather-dependent vs. runway always available)
