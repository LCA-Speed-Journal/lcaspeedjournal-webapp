7th and 8th grade athletes may qualify for Varsity Track through two new methods: (1) submitting official documentation from prior Track & Field or XC competitions, or (2) participating in the Track & Field Combine during the first week of varsity practices.

**Important:** When an athlete meets the advancement criteria, **families now have the choice** to decide which practice group (middle school or varsity) is the best fit for their athlete.
