# Big Ideas

## Foot and Lower-Leg as Foundation
The foot and lower leg are the foundation for speed and power development. This includes:
- **Spring Ankle Training**: 2 minutes straight-knee, 2 minutes bent-knee - all tension moves to foot
- **3 Phases of the Shank**: Progressive development of shank mechanics
- **Speed Bounce**: Plantar-flexor chain (calf muscles, Achilles, foot muscles) development for elasticity
- **Ankle Stiffness**: Ability to absorb/produce force quickly - critical for speed
- **Neural Targeting**: "What the feet don't do, the rest has to" - feet must be trained to handle force

## TFL and Psoas
- **TFL (Tensor Fasciae Latae)**: Gives hip internal rotation, seen as one of the most important muscles for high-performance (almost above the psoas)
- **Psoas**: Hip flexor that loves high-force training
- Training these muscles is critical for proper hip mechanics and sprint performance

## Hamstring and Adductor Magnus
- **Adductor Magnus**: Hip extensor, dominant muscle in female sprinters. Can train with straight-leg hip extension with foot turned in
- **Hamstring Training**: 
  - Semitendinosis: Key muscle, needs >7m/s to be fully activated, so drills need to be done at speed
  - Bicep Femoris: Likes speed, not load
  - Foot-in position targets semitendinosis, foot-out targets semimembranosis
- **Better Nordic**: Leg-curl ISO (5-on, 5-off) performed on floor

## Capacity Work
While leaning toward a low-volume model, Korfist is not opposed to a little more capacity work compared to strict low-volume approaches. This allows for more comprehensive development while maintaining quality.

## Explosive Foot
- **Neural Targeting**: What the feet don't do, the rest has to compensate
- **Spring Ankle**: Foundation exercise (2min straight-knee, 2min bent-knee)
- **SL Box Jump with Plantarflexion**: Develops explosive foot action
- **Toe Plank on Ledge**: Forward of big toe, develops foot strength

## Weight Room for Speed
- **Overrides**: Body position (especially cervical), output over exercises/sets/reps, autoregulate when possible
- **Supramaximal-ECC Actions**: Have increased neuromuscular change, suggest impact on neural drive
- **Obliques**: Long holds (2min), good spine, breathe
- **Transverse**: Opposite shoulder, single-leg bound
- **Force-Velocity Curve**: 
  - Force: 1-3x, 5s push (2-3 sets)
  - Power: Time-based (10s for power-strength, 30s for power-endurance)
  - Velocity: 30% 1RM, 3-4 sets for time

## Acceleration and First Step
- **Where to Push**: Too vertical on takeoff means not pushing hard enough off back foot
- **First Step**: Rear block is most important factor, followed by force-horizontal in front
- **Coaching Points**: 
  - Belly button should be where hand is when legs are even (coming out of blocks)
  - Step-ups: Foot out in front, under = drive with back
- **Back Pushes into Shin-Roll**: Exercise for developing first step mechanics

## Three Drill Series
Progressive 13-week system for improving form:
1. **Booms**: Stress movement while other actions occur - tall posture, reaching for ground, knees passing high
2. **Hip Hike/High-Hip Action**: Better position for hips - stance leg directly under hip socket, swing leg hip slightly higher
3. **Ankle-Foot Action**: Works on stiffness of ankle - keep ankles as stiff as possible

## Training Organization
### Grouping by Deficiency (3-Group System)
- **Pullers**: Limb-velocity (4.2Hz) - leg-swings, overspeed, rotational torso work, horizontal-push strength
- **Pushers**: ECC-RFD (vertical) + hamstring follow-through - bent-leg prime-times, banded booms/switches, straight-leg hamstring pull-throughs
- **Strikers**: Feet, hips, and "about everything else" - mini-hurdles, prime-times, short maxV reps, lateral sling work, general strength

### Weekly Planning Structure
- **Day 1**: Film Fly-10's (front/back/profile), stratify into tiers
- **Day 2**: 40m runs on 1080 (resistance on shoulders, not waist)
- **Monday**: Tier 1 (1080 work), Tier 2/3 (flys, prime-times, line-hops)
- **Tuesday**: Tier 1 (ISO-foot and torso / 400 work), Tier 2/3 (drills, mini-hurdles)
- **Wednesday**: Tier 1 (2pt accel), Tier 2/3 (OFF)
- **Thursday**: Tier 1 (OFF), Tier 2/3 (23 second runs - lactic)
- **Friday**: Tier 1 (blocks work), Tier 2/3 (weights)

### General Planning Principles
- **Balance Before Movement**: Step 1 - Breathe, Step 2 - Horizon
- **Bucket 1**: Force/power-dominant, first 4-6 weeks just acceleration
- **Bucket 2**: Balancing acceleration with max-velocity (roughly 3 MaxV to 2 Accel)
- **Bucket 3**: MaxV, strength, and speed-endurance

## Specific Fixes
- **Low-Force**: Max-effort wall-pushes
- **Low-Power**: Resisted runs at light-medium load (50% vDec at most)
- **Crossover-Gait**: Symptom of lateral instability/glute-med weakness

# Web-Summary

Chris Korfist is a renowned speed coach and co-founder of the Track Football Consortium (TFC) with Tony Holler, an educational platform that has revolutionized speed training methodology. His training philosophy centers on the foot and lower leg as the foundation for speed and power development, emphasizing spring ankle training, speed bounce, and ankle stiffness as critical components. Korfist's approach integrates specific muscle targeting (TFL, psoas, hamstring, adductor magnus) with a sophisticated understanding of force-velocity relationships and neural targeting principles. He developed the Three Drill Series for improving sprint form and created innovative training organization systems that group athletes by deficiency (Pullers, Pushers, Strikers). Korfist's work emphasizes the explosive foot, proper acceleration mechanics, and the importance of the first step, with a focus on horizontal force application and ground contact mechanics. Through TFC and Revolutions in Speed events, he has established himself as a leading authority on speed development, particularly in the context of track and field and football performance.
