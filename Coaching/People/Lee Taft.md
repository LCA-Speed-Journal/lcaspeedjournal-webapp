## General to Specific Speed
Athletes Acceleration general to specific speed approach.

### Core Concepts
- **Escape or Chase** - General Sport Concept: Athletes need to make decision quickly
- **Good Techniques and Posture**
- **The Magic of Sport** - Live-Action and Predicting Movement
  - These inform which corrective-drills you do - patterns athletes use when *reacting* to things
- **If you want Athletes to Improve, need to Force Them to Compete**

### Live-Drilling: Programming
- Great as Warmups - can use as Movement Screen, gets athletes more involved/engaged, narrows focus
- Good as part of Whole-Part Approach, seeing what natural tendencies of athletes are before putting corrective-drills on top

### Hands-On: Field-Work
Hands-on field-work components for speed development.

# Web-Summary

Lee Taft is a coach with Athletes Acceleration known for his general to specific speed approach, emphasizing core concepts like "Escape or Chase" (general sport concept where athletes need to make decisions quickly), good techniques and posture, "The Magic of Sport" (live-action and predicting movement that inform which corrective-drills to use—patterns athletes use when reacting to things), and the principle that "if you want athletes to improve, need to force them to compete." His live-drilling programming approach recognizes that live drills are great as warmups (can use as movement screen, gets athletes more involved/engaged, narrows focus) and good as part of whole-part approach (seeing what natural tendencies of athletes are before putting corrective-drills on top). Through his emphasis on reactive, game-like training and his systematic approach to speed development, Taft has established a methodology that bridges general athleticism with sport-specific speed application.
