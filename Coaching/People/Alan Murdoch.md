Alan Murdoch is a coach associated with Speedworks, known for defining speed through the graphic "Characteristics of Speed" which emphasizes that speed is about "Large forces, short time frames, right direction"—it's a game of Impulse. Through his work with Speedworks and his contribution to defining the fundamental characteristics of speed, Murdoch has helped establish clear understanding of what speed training must address: force application, temporal factors, and directional efficiency.
