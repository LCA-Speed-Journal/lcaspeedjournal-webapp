# Big Ideas

## Racehorse 2 Program Structure
Training program with specific structure and methodology:

### Big Pieces
- **3x Sprint+Lower, 2x Upper** per week
- **Sprint Days**: Rate-Mag-Capacity (see [[Dimensions of the CNS]] and [[DB Hammer]])
- **Timed AMRAPs**: Usually in 5-7s range, not much above 10s (fits Power-Phase of [[Triphasic Training]])
- **Superblock-Style Sprint Training**: Inspired by [[Chris Korfist]], [[Dan Fichter]] (see [[Foundations of Speed]])
- **Band Resistance/Assistance**: Similar to [[Triphasic Training]] elements
- **Drawback**: Minimal Vertical-Jump Training, more for speed

### Key Concepts
- **Extensive-Rapid-Strides**: Progressive warmup structure that gets gradually more intense while also getting good amount of low-to-mid level plyos involved
- **Superblock-Style Speed Work**: Training approach using superblocks
- **Rate-Mag-Capacity Sprint Days**: Organizing sprint training around dimensions of CNS (Rate, Magnitude, Capacity)
- **Working Accessory Patterns into Main Lift**: Placing accessory work alongside main lift as superset/circuit rather than at end of workout

# Web-Summary

Lachen Reid is the creator of the Racehorse 2 training program, a sophisticated system that structures training with 3x Sprint+Lower and 2x Upper sessions per week. His approach organizes sprint days around the Dimensions of the CNS framework (Rate-Magnitude-Capacity), integrating timed AMRAPs typically in the 5-7 second range (fitting the power phase of Triphasic Training). Reid's program uses superblock-style sprint training inspired by Chris Korfist and Dan Fichter, incorporating band resistance/assistance similar to Triphasic Training elements. The Racehorse 2 system includes extensive-rapid-strides as a progressive warmup structure that gradually increases intensity while incorporating low-to-mid level plyometrics. Reid's approach emphasizes working accessory patterns into main lifts as supersets/circuits rather than at the end of workouts, creating efficient training structures. While the program is more focused on speed development with minimal vertical jump training, it provides a comprehensive framework for athletes prioritizing linear speed. Through Racehorse 2, Reid has established a systematic approach to integrating sprint and strength work with clear neurological organization principles.
