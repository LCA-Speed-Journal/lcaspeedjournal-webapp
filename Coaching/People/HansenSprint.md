## [[10 x 10m Protocol]]: Hamstring Rehab

# Publications / Projects

# Web-Summary

HansenSprint is a coaching resource focused on hamstring rehabilitation using the 10 x 10m protocol, providing a systematic approach to returning athletes from hamstring injuries through progressive sprint-based rehabilitation. The protocol emphasizes controlled, progressive exposure to sprinting at short distances (10 meters) with specific volume and intensity parameters, recognizing that hamstring rehabilitation requires careful progression from basic movement to high-speed sprinting. Through this focused approach to hamstring rehabilitation, HansenSprint has established a practical protocol for addressing one of the most common injuries in sprint-based sports.
