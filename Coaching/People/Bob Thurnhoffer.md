# Big Ideas

## Long Jump Technique
University of Louisville comprehensive long jump technique.

### Approach
- **Vision at Start**: Eyes on board is encouraged, but eventually moves to peripheral
- **Start Closer to Upright/Moderate Accel-Angle**: Thigh-Split Yes, Shins Match Spine
- **Consistent Start**: Even just adding little hop at start can wildly throw off where you end up
- **Upright by Step 6-8**: Tracking board at this point
- **Uniform Accel – Crescendo – Speed**: Distribute the Run and Energy Usage
  - Sufficient, Patient Push, get Pelvis into Neutral
  - [[Dan Pfaff]]: "If you have 9V battery, and you use 7V in approach, you're in trouble by takeoff"
  - Up to 90-95% maxV - it's still LJ, there's optimal cost to setting up good penult/takeoff mechanism
  - LJ is 2:1 horizontal to vertical relationship

### Postural Alignment
- **Head**: Spine aligned with pelvis, shin-angles match spine
- **Shank**: ~Perpendicular at ground-strike, free-leg heel-to-butt, knees together in mid-stance

### Amplitude of Movement
- Preserve undulation of COM - oscillation of pelvis creates stretch-reflex
- [[Ken Clark]] and [[Peter Weyand]] - Whip from the Hip
- Full-ROM Sprinting, but fast
- Dorsiflex
- Strike firmly, and vertical

### Penult and Takeoff
- **Run to the Penultimate** - Ground the Penult in Tall-Position
- **Quiet Landing on Penult** - Flat/Quiet Takeoff
- **Tight Takeoff** - Vertical lift from short takeoff
- **Jump Late** - Jumping *past* the board, leaving foot behind (connects to [[Dario Saisan (SaisanTraining)]] and [[Delayed Knee Extension]])
- **Run (Past/Thru/to the Other Side of/Up and Away From) the Board** - DISPLACEMENT is key
- **Set Foot on Board, then Move to Other Side** - Glute-Ham-Quad in that order

### Flight and Landing
- **Sprint Posture**: Keep this through landing
- **Stay Linear**: Feet are in Front, Posture is Tall, Slightly Flexed to help Absorb
- **Elongation of Free-Leg**: To counter over-rotation
- **Arm-Sweep**
- **Moving into Landing Position *sooner* Rather than Later**

# Web-Summary

Bob Thurnhoffer is a University of Louisville coach specializing in comprehensive long jump technique, with particular emphasis on approach mechanics, postural alignment, amplitude of movement, and penult/takeoff mechanics. 
His approach recognizes that vision at start should have eyes on board (eventually moving to peripheral), that athletes should start closer to upright with moderate acceleration angle (thigh-split yes, shins match spine), and that consistent start is critical (even a little hop can throw off approach). 
Thurnhoffer emphasizes:
- uniform acceleration-crescendo-speed, 
- distributing run and energy usage with sufficient, 
- patient push to get pelvis into neutral, 
- reaching 90-95% maxV (recognizing long jump is 2:1 horizontal to vertical relationship). 
His postural alignment principles emphasize:
- spine aligned with pelvis, 
- shin-angles matching spine, 
- shank perpendicular at ground-strike, 
- free-leg heel-to-butt, 
- knees together in mid-stance.
Thurnhoffer's amplitude of movement concepts preserve undulation of center of mass (oscillation of pelvis creates stretch-reflex), incorporate "whip from the hip" (as Ken Clark and Peter Weyand), and emphasize full-ROM sprinting with dorsiflexion and firm, vertical striking. 
His penult and takeoff mechanics include:
- running to the penultimate (grounding penult in tall position), 
- quiet landing on penult (flat/quiet takeoff), 
- tight takeoff (vertical lift from short takeoff), 
- jumping late (jumping past the board, leaving foot behind, connecting to delayed knee extension concepts),
- setting foot on board then moving to other side (glute-ham-quad in that order). 
Through his systematic approach to long jump technique, Thurnhoffer has established a comprehensive framework for developing jumpers.
