# Big Ideas

## Facility Management
Works with [[Mike Boyle]] - facility management covering three big concepts.

### Three Big Concepts
- **People: Staffing and Leadership**
  - "Find the **right people**, not the best people"
  - Internships: great way to find right people
  - Lead from Front: can't sit on sidelines and be leader
  - Regular Staff Meetings: Centerpoint of Communication
  - Retaining Staff = Retaining Clients
- **Systems: Principles and Programming**
  - "Be firm on Principle, but Flexible on Method"
  - Know your System: write out model, have clear understanding of principles
  - Build Commercially Friendly Model: what can you *realistically* deliver in 60mins?
  - Training is Recipe, not Menu: unified approach to programming, coaching, and education
- **Execution: Client Relationships and Coaching**
  - "People Don't Buy What You Do, They Buy Why You Do It"
  - 10/5 Rule: within 10ft, smile and make eye contact - within 5ft, verbally greet/engage
  - Teaching 101: 30s or Less, give 3 great demos (right, wrong, right)
