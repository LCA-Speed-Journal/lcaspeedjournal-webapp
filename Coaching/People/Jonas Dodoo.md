# Big Ideas

## Breaking Down Sprint Mechanics
Speedworks and VueMotion - Comprehensive sprint mechanics breakdown.

### PSR Model (Projection, Switching, Reactivity)
- **Projection**: Horizontal orientation of movement, how much hip extension do you use to do it?
  - Foot PUSHING Behind the Hip
- **Switching**: Rapid backwards-attack with front-thigh while back punches forward
  - In-Air Repositioning
  - High Thigh-Angular-Velo
- **Reactivity**: Limited drop/sinking around hip/knee/ankle when on ground, fast GCT

### Whip From the Hip
(As [[Ken Clark]] and [[Peter Weyand]])
- To punch hard, need enough room to accelerate (thigh-angle needs to be high enough)
- Shortens at hip, lengthens at knee (helps minimize strain)

## Hamstring Injury Factors
(Same study from [[JB Morin]]'s references)
- **Lumbo-Pelvic Control** - Influences load-transference to hamstrings due to anatomical connection between pelvis and hamstrings
- **Anterior Pelvic Tilt** - Lengthens proximal hamstrings, putting them under higher strain
- **Forwards Trunk Lean** - Increases hamstring-length at stance (higher strain), may lead to compensations
- **Trunk Lateral Flexion** - Alters lever-arms of trunk, reduces stability at pelvis
- **Maximal Hip-Flexion Angle** - Greater angle increases distance but may increase tissue length, peak forces, and negative work
- **Back-Side Mechanics** - Increases length of hip-flexors with subsequent pelvic-impacts
- **Overstriding** - Higher Peak-Braking, increases demands on hamstring to reaccelerate COM

## Performance Correlations
### 0-10m Times
- **Thigh-Angular Velocity** - Biggest KPI for 0-10m
- Thigh separation range - not as big a deal
- Step-Frequency - not a big deal
- Hip Displacement - not as big a deal

### Step Characteristics
- **Step Length**: Most correlated with step-frequency (negative relationship)
- **Step Frequency**: GCT correlated to both frequency and touchdown distance
- **Thigh Angular-Velo**: Correlated with thigh-separation and thigh-punch

### Linking Correlations to PSR System
- **Projection**: How far can you travel forwards, looking at separation and punch, as well as push
- **Switching**: How well can you *rip* legs through (early extension attack-velo, early flexion attack-velo)
- **Reactivity**: Looking at touchdown distance and GCT (good spot to minimize braking)

## Athlete Variability
Coming back to [[James Wild]]'s Quadrant system:
- Looking at Coefficient of Variation (SD/Mean * 100) of less than 10% within athletes
- Constrained to within same days, rep-to-rep
- Change above typical variability (> 1x CV) will have significant impact on success

### Quadrants
1. **Quadrant 1**: Length + Air-Time
2. **Quadrant 2**: Length + Ground-Time
3. **Quadrant 3**: Frequency + Ground-Time
4. **Quadrant 4**: Frequency + Air-Time

# Web-Summary

Jonas Dodoo is a researcher and coach specializing in sprint mechanics and performance analysis, known for his work with Speedworks and VueMotion in breaking down the complex biomechanics of sprinting. His PSR (Projection, Switching, Reactivity) model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding sprint performance, emphasizing horizontal orientation of movement, rapid leg switching through high thigh angular velocity, and minimal ground contact time through reactive stiffness. Dodoo's research focuses on the critical role of thigh angular velocity in acceleration performance, the importance of the "whip from the hip" mechanism for efficient force application, and the biomechanical factors contributing to hamstring injury risk. His work integrates performance correlations with technical coaching, linking metrics like thigh separation, step frequency, and ground contact time to sprint outcomes. Through his analytical approach to sprint mechanics, Dodoo has contributed significantly to the understanding of what makes elite sprinters fast, providing coaches with evidence-based frameworks for technical development and performance optimization.
