# Big Ideas

## Individualizing Training in Large Groups
Homewood Flossmoor approach to individualizing training in large group settings.

### Context
- **HF Weightroom**: 2800 students at school, ~1200 in one or more sports
- **20 Sections During Day** (growth of almost 10x during Adam's time)
- **13 Staff Members** (6x Performance Staff, 7x PE Staff)
- Vast majority of strength staff are also sport coaches
- Juniors and seniors who have been in program 3-4 years act as peer leaders within sections

## Effective Grouping Strategies
### Common Problems Addressed
- Sport Specific Individualization (do you just do GPP for everyone to hit lowest-common?)
- How to account for athlete-specific flexibility/mobility deficits without detracting from program
- How to handle Large Training Groups
- Time Constraints with Large-Group Settings

### Solutions
- **Allow for Progressions/Regressions**, as well as modifications
- **Individualization based on Phases of Development**
- **Have a General Plan that gets more specific**
- **Limit Transitions**
- **Stay Simple**: Add Layers (Complexity) when they can prove efficiency

## Creating Individualized S&C System
### Principle-Based Approach
- **Procedures** - Things established before starting (written program, rack-assignments)
- **Practices** - What is done during session
- **Protocols** - Adjustments made due to practices (what can be done to adjust)

### Strategic Grouping
- **Sports** - Linear, Vertical, Rotational, Contact (can be multiple, generally just one)
- **Positional Needs** - Track events, football positions, etc
- **Seasons** - In-Season vs Offseason
- **Individual Needs** - Attack the Limiting Factors

### Procedures/Protocols
- Uses [[Joe Kenn]] and [[Mike Boyle]]'s style of systemizing
- Starts with **1x20 for super beginners** - freshman did for entire semester
- **Post-Activation-Potentiation** - Pairing slower movements with explosive movements
- "There are no solutions, only trade-offs"

### Boyle's Ideas
- Big Multijoint movements - 1-2x p/wk at least
- **Knee-Hinge** (Squat-Patterns, DL can count)
  - Just worry about getting to 1.7x BW, then start looking more at patterning for power
  - Front-Squat until 1.3x BW, then they earn right to Back-Squat
  - Band-System: green band to back-squat, purple to move to power
- Bilateral and Unilateral Work
- Frontal-Plane (Lunging, Good-Morning)
- Horizontal Pressing / Vertical Pressing (above/below 45deg)
- Few more pulling patterns than pushing patterns
- Concussion Reduction / Contact Prep
- Shoulder Complex
- Rotational Core-Work
- Posterior Chain - Clean-Grip DL, get that to 2x BW then move to Trap-Bar
- Ankle/Foot Complex

## Training Structure and Sport-Individualization
- **15 Essentials, 15 Added-Essentials** (23 for some groups)
  - 15x during week, 15-18x after school

### Weekly Structure
- **Two Tri-sets in class-period** - A (1, 2, 3) and B (1, 2, 3)
  - Can sub out patterns depending on in-season, out of season, sport-needs, etc.
- **After school, 75mins** - 3x p/wk p/gender for sports (M-W-F for girls, T-Th-F for boys)
- **Undulating Structure** for in-season, more linear blocks for out-of-season

### Phases of Development
- **Movement → Strength → Power → Speed → Capacity**
- Refer to general development of athlete, not necessarily defined timeline
- Just using different components with each phase, focusing something different
  - Movement is mostly everything
  - Strength is mostly STR with some power
  - Power is mostly Power with microdosed Strength
  - Speed maintains qualities but leans into velocity

## Decision-Tree Modeling, Individualization, and VBT
- Allowing athletes to **auto-regulate based on velocity targets**
  - 0.25 m/s over, adding load, and vice versa for 0.25 m/s under

# Web-Summary

Adam Vogel is a Homewood Flossmoor coach known for his approach to individualizing training in large group settings, working with a weightroom serving 2800 students and ~1200 athletes across 20 sections during the day with 13 staff members. His system addresses common problems like sport-specific individualization, accounting for athlete-specific flexibility/mobility deficits, handling large training groups, and time constraints. Vogel's solutions include allowing for progressions/regressions and modifications, individualization based on phases of development, having a general plan that gets more specific, limiting transitions, and staying simple while adding layers of complexity when athletes can prove efficiency. He uses a principle-based approach with procedures (things established before starting), practices (what is done during session), and protocols (adjustments made due to practices). Vogel's strategic grouping considers sports (linear, vertical, rotational, contact), positional needs, seasons (in-season vs offseason), and individual needs (attacking limiting factors). His training structure includes 15 essentials and 15 added-essentials, with two tri-sets in class period and after-school sessions. Through decision-tree modeling and velocity-based training allowing athletes to auto-regulate based on velocity targets, Vogel has established a sophisticated system for individualizing training at scale.
