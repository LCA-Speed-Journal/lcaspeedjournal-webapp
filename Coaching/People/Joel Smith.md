# Big Ideas

## Elastic Essentials System
Comprehensive system organizing elastic training resources covering:
- The need for elastic training
- Training the feet for reactive power
- Bodyweight training basics
- Plyometrics based on timing, fluidity, and levers
- Emphasis on **foot and lower leg as foundation** for speed and power

## The Need for Elastic Training
### Transfer Questions
- How exercises transfer to athletic skills
- Understanding principles of movement, arches, levers, pressure, free-energy return
- Engaging elastic mechanisms effectively

### Left vs Right Brain in Coaching and Performance
- Understanding transfer requires both analytical and intuitive approaches
- Key to athletic performance transfer: understanding principles of movement

## Training the Feet for Reactive Power
### Key Concepts
- **Movement powered by muscles setting up joints to harness connective tissue power**
- **Fascia and tensegrity principles** - Understanding how connective tissue stores and releases energy
- **Arches and domes** - Three arches forming natural domes
- **Athletic foot shape** - Curled toes, prominent extensor tendons
- **Pronation/supination** - Mobile adapter vs rigid lever

### Foot Training Philosophy
- Foot and lower leg as foundation for speed and power
- Training feet to handle forces effectively
- Developing reactive strength in foot-ankle complex

## Bodyweight Training Basics
### Advantages/Disadvantages
- Comparison table of bodyweight vs resistance training
- Complexity and athletic adaptation (left brain vs right brain thinking)

### Human Movements
- Climb, hang, roll, aerial inversion, squat, lunge, crawl, gait
- Programming considerations for bodyweight work

## Plyometrics Based on Timing, Fluidity, and Levers
### Philosophy
- Plyometrics train rebounding ability of human body
- Create intense training stimulus for muscle, bones and connective tissues
- Train "same but different" relative to common explosive sport actions
- Dis-inhibit neurological "brakes" on athlete through specific overload
- Facilitate smoothness, rhythm and timing of movement in elastic situations
- Help athletes feel and understand shifts in foot lever system

### "Strength" vs "Elastic" Oriented Plyometrics
- **Strength oriented**: Focus on strength of tissues and yielding, Heavy "Class 1 Lever" usage, longer contact times
- **Elastic**: Focus on biomechanical optimization and reactivity, Emphasizes "Class 2 Lever" usage, shorter contact times

### Lever System
- **Class 1 Dominant (Heel)**: Characterized by "Strength", pronation, and compression
- **Class 2 Dominant (Rigid Ball of Foot Action)**: Not easy to train outside of smaller, vertically oriented movements
- **Class 1 to 2 Emphasis**: Transitioning to Ball of Foot Quickly - Characterized by speed, supination and expansion bias

### Spiraling Effects in Jumping
- Legs work from external rotation, to internal, back to external after takeoff
- More force needed in shorter time = more external rotation portion needs to be biased
- Powerful expansive strategy to absorb massive forces in foot contact

### Plyometric Implementation
- Optimize Class 1 Lever Timing
- Strengthen Class 2 Lever: Maximal Load Potential
- Class 1 to Class 2 Transition: Basic and Advanced ("Crushing the Shoe")
- Foot Arch and Achilles Tendon Timing
- Muscle-Tendon Tuning and Rhythm
- Yielding Plyometrics

# Web-Summary

Joel Smith is the creator of the Elastic Essentials system, a comprehensive approach to training that emphasizes the foot and lower leg as the foundation for speed and power development. His philosophy centers on understanding how movement is powered by muscles setting up joints to harness connective tissue power, with deep integration of fascia and tensegrity principles. Smith's work emphasizes training the feet for reactive power through understanding arches, domes, and the athletic foot shape, recognizing the foot's dual role as both mobile adapter and rigid lever. His plyometric system is based on timing, fluidity, and levers, distinguishing between "strength-oriented" and "elastic" plyometrics, with sophisticated understanding of Class 1 and Class 2 lever systems and their application to jumping and sprinting. Smith's approach to bodyweight training emphasizes natural human movements (climb, hang, roll, aerial inversion, squat, lunge, crawl, gait) and recognizes the complexity and athletic adaptation benefits of bodyweight work. Through his Elastic Essentials system and hosting of the Just Fly Performance podcast, Smith has established himself as a leading voice in understanding and developing the elastic qualities essential for athletic performance.
