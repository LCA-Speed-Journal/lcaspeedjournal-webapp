## 4x100m Relay Optimization
Ventura College 4x100m relay optimization.

### Relay Legs
- Legs 1, 3 will run on inside (left-half) and receive baton in right hand
- Legs 2, 4 will run on outside (right-half) and receive baton in left hand

### Relay Measurements
- **Old**: Acceleration Zone (10m) → Exchange Zone (20m)
- **New**: No Accel-Zone, just 30m Exchange-Zone

### Typical Acceleration vs Deceleration
- 60% by 10m - 85% by 20m - 95% by 30m
- Decel: 98% at 80m - 95% at 90m-100m

### The Cardinal Rules of the Relay
- Outgoing runner sets up at very beginning of exchange zone
- Baton Exchange should happen near 20m mark to maximize outgoing-acceleration

### Determining When to "GO"
- First Piece - 16-24 steps from start of zone
- Second Piece - Measure Back 4 more Steps (creating "Go-Zone")
  - Outgoing leaves when incoming enters Go-Zone

### Guidance for Outgoing Runner
- May stand/crouch, but feet should be pointed down track
- Aggressive Start, don't come out with hesitation
- Extend soft, steady hand on verbal cue
- Grasp baton *after* placed in hand - don't go fishing
- Don't look back!

### Guidance for Incoming Runner
- Must push through zone - "Catching the Outgoing Runner"
- Give verbal cue at appropriate time
- Extend baton at appropriate time
- Maintain speed in zone *after* pass
- Stay in lane until all other teams have completed passes

### Methods of Exchanging Baton
- **Overhand Downsweep Pass** (American-Style Pass)
- **Push-Pass** - By far most popular with current US and International Teams
- **Underhand Upsweep Pass** - Used by Japan

# Web-Summary

Brian Fitzgerald is a Ventura College coach specializing in 4x100m relay optimization, with comprehensive understanding of relay mechanics and exchange techniques. His approach emphasizes that legs 1 and 3 run on the inside (left-half) and receive baton in right hand, while legs 2 and 4 run on outside (right-half) and receive baton in left hand. Fitzgerald's system recognizes the new relay measurements (no acceleration zone, just 30m exchange zone) and typical acceleration/deceleration patterns (60% by 10m, 85% by 20m, 95% by 30m; deceleration: 98% at 80m, 95% at 90-100m). His cardinal rules emphasize that outgoing runner sets up at the very beginning of exchange zone, and baton exchange should happen near 20m mark to maximize outgoing acceleration. Fitzgerald's method for determining when to "go" uses first piece (16-24 steps from start of zone) and second piece (measuring back 4 more steps, creating "go-zone" where outgoing leaves when incoming enters). He provides detailed guidance for both outgoing runners (aggressive start, extend soft steady hand on verbal cue, grasp baton after placed in hand, don't look back) and incoming runners (must push through zone, give verbal cue, extend baton at appropriate time, maintain speed in zone after pass). Fitzgerald recognizes three methods of exchanging baton: overhand downsweep pass (American-style), push-pass (most popular with current US and international teams), and underhand upsweep pass (used by Japan). Through his systematic approach to relay training, Fitzgerald has established a comprehensive methodology for maximizing relay performance.
