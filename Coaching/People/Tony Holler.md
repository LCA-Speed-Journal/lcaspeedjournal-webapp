# Big Ideas

## Feed the Cats Philosophy
Founder of Feed the Cats - a low-volume, high-quality training philosophy emphasizing:
- **Ridiculously Brief Practices**: Keep sprint practice short and focused
- **High-Rest, Fresh Approach**: "Tired is not the goal, tired is the enemy"
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Better off doing less at high-quality versus more at mid-to-low-quality
- **Speed Priority**: Sprint as fast as possible, as often as possible, while staying as fresh as possible

## Low-Volume Model
Core principle: "The Dose Makes the Poison"
- **Don't sprint more than three times a week**
- **One day needs to be a lactate workout** (speed day)
- **Other days are X-Factor days** - break from sprinting, alactic work
- **Rest is more important than any workout** - twice as many OFF-DAYS as lactate + meet days
- **Weekly algorithm**: Speed + Lactate + Meets = 3

### The Atomic Speed Workout
Ten speed drills:
- Fast march, skips
- High knees, butt kicks
- 5 box jumps, bounding
- Prime times x2
- Butt-kick and reach x2
- One falling start into a full sprint

Then: **Time three short sprints.** Average the best two, then Record-Rank-Publish.

## A Simple Plan
Tony's comprehensive approach to coaching Track & Field:
1. Keep sprint practice **ridiculously brief**
2. **Time your sprinters** in short sprints
3. **Record, Rank, and Publish**
4. Don't sprint more than **three times a week**
5. One day needs to be a **lactate** workout
6. Other days are **X-Factor** (break from sprinting)
7. Keep **distance kids (≥800m) separate** from sprinters
8. Allow **jump training to take the place of a speed day** or do jumps in addition
9. Same principles apply to **hurdling**

### Speed Days
- Short warmup, then time some sprints
- Don't warm up extensively, don't stretch
- Focus on timing and recording performance

### X-Factor Days
- Keep **ridiculously SHORT** (45 minutes)
- Goal: Every kid feels better after workout than before (except lactic)
- **Never do lactate work** (≥10s of intensity)
- **Never do aerobic work** (long, slow, conversational)
- Examples: Wickets, Hurdle Mobility, Depth Jumps and Assisted Plyos

### Lactate Workouts
- Never more than twice in a week
- **Meets count as lactate workouts**
- Lactate workouts take the place of a sprint day
- Keep lactate workouts away from meets and sprint workouts (48-hour hangover)
- **Lactate work does NOT build speed** - anything you do for more than five seconds will NOT improve speed

## Record, Rank, and Publish
Core methodology for athlete motivation and accountability:
- **Record**: Time sprinters in short sprints (Fly-10s, 30-40yd flys)
- **Rank**: Compare performances, create competition
- **Publish**: Make results visible - leaderboards, social media, team boards
- Creates culture of competition and continuous improvement
- "Happy sprinters are your best recruiters"

### Hand-Timing Flys
- If only have stopwatch: time three 40s (boys hurdle marks are 10 yards apart)
- Shortest fly: 30 yards
- Have trustworthy slow kid drop hand at start of fly
- Use hurdle at start and end of fly as visual marker

## Relay Work (4x100m)
"The Pissing Contest of Track Coaches"
- **Train a group of 8, not 4** - build alternates, create a "squad"
- **Lane Ownership**: Athletes share lane for good handoff (inside and outside)
- **Drilling Handoffs**: 
  - Jogging Handoff Drill - practice hand positions (Stop-Sign and Candlestick)
  - One Perfect Handoff - not going for reps, going for one perfect rep
- **Bang Step Technique**: Uses 2 tennis balls - incoming inside zone, outgoing 1st step is down on track
- **Order Strategy**: 
  - Big-guys generally work better on straightaways
  - Best 2 guys on straightaways - strongest on 2nd
  - Anchors are most competitive
  - 2nd and 3rd leg need to both give/receive - reliability
- **Record the baton, not the guy** - record splits of relays

## Simplified Approach to Blocks, Batons, and Hurdles

### Starting Blocks
- **Acceleration is important, but MaxV is king** (contrast to [[Chris Korfist]] who leans more on acceleration)
- Block-starts can be supplemental volume at end of practice - not very fatiguing
- **Shin angles dictate where athlete goes**:
  - Don't be too high, will pop up
  - Don't be too low, might stumble or break at waist
- **Eyes need to "see the track"** - gaze down, keep head in line with spine
- **Easiest place to start**: 2-Feet and 3-Feet
- **Learning What NOT to Do**:
  - Don't keep hands flat against ground - need bridge with hands
  - Don't "stay low" - leads to breaking at waist
  - Beware huge split - leads to overextending front leg
  - Don't lift from foot - leads to early cycling
  - Don't try too hard, don't think too much - both are qualities of slow athletes

### Acceleration Drills
- Partner Pushes
- MB Throws
- 10m Hill-Sprints
- Wall Drill
- Resistance Bands
- Sleds

### Hurdles
- **Objective #1: FIND THE HURDLERS** - bad track program has no hurdlers
- **Teach 3-Step first** - if they can't do it, they shouldn't hurdle in meet
- **Discount the Height, Discount the Distance**
- **Do Low-Impact Drills daily** (see [[Alec Holler]])
- **Quality, never Quantity** - spiked-up, only over 1 or 2
- **Never hurdling when tired**
- **Lead-Leg should be back in blocks** (otherwise 7-stepping to first)
- **Lead with the knee, not with the foot**
- **Need aggressive hip-position** - hip should project forward past cut-step
- **Emphasis on cut-step** - step right before hurdle is touch short
- **Don't get too close to first hurdle** (7ft for boys, 6.5 for girls)
- "Show athlete video without coach-commentary - let them respond and ask for guidance"

## Jumps Training
- **Jump training can take place of speed day** or do jumps in addition
- **Jump as little as possible** - keep jumpers as fresh as possible
- **Jumpers who will never run 200 and 400 should never do lactate workouts**
- Work with each jump one day per week (HJ one day, LJ one day, TJ one day)
- Encourage specialty coaches to "make appointments" with kids on weekends

## High-Rest Philosophy
- **Value of High-Rest**: Facilitate high outputs by being fresh
- **Rest is the priority** - twice as many OFF-DAYS as lactate + meet days
- **Pure speed doesn't improve during season** - must sprint all summer, fall, AND winter
- Sprinters get faster at 100, 200, 400 but get slower in 10m fly during season
- Can't go "Clyde Hart" all winter - can't run laps in hallways or miles on frozen tundra
- Sprinting (or acceleration and plyos) must be done all winter

## General Rules
- Keep lactate workouts away from meets and sprint workouts (48-hour hangover)
- Weekly algorithm: **Speed + Lactate + Meets = 3**
- If three meets in week: NO speed workouts and no lactate workouts
- **Never do aerobic work with sprinters, EVER**
- This method trains ALL sprinters: 100, 200, 400, 110 HH, 300 INT, 4×1, 4×2, 4×4, jumpers, vaulters
- **Tired is not the goal, tired is the enemy**

# Web-Summary

Tony Holler is the founder of the Feed the Cats training philosophy, a revolutionary low-volume, high-quality approach to sprint training that emphasizes "ridiculously brief practices" and the principle that "tired is not the goal, tired is the enemy." His methodology centers on sprinting as fast as possible, as often as possible, while staying as fresh as possible, with a strict weekly algorithm limiting speed work to three times per week (Speed + Lactate + Meets = 3). Holler's system prioritizes quality over quantity, high-rest periods, and the Record-Rank-Publish methodology for athlete motivation. He co-founded the Track Football Consortium (TFC) with Chris Korfist and is a major proponent of RPR (Reflexive Performance Reset). His approach challenges traditional high-volume training models by demonstrating that maximal speed development requires freshness and recovery, not fatigue, and has influenced countless coaches through his Feed the Cats philosophy and educational events.
