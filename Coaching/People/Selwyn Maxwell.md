## High-Hurdler Development
UCONN coach covering technical components of hurdling.

### Technical Components
- **Takeoff**: Distance from hurdle (7ft for men, 6.5ft for women), lean forward from hip not waist, driving knee of lead leg up + FWD, strong push-off from back-leg
- **Cut-Step**: Final stride before takeoff - shorter and quicker than preceding strides, low to ground to maintain momentum, foot-placement is key factor
- **Hurdle Clearance**: Focus on minimizing time spent over top, not height above hurdle
  - Lead Leg: driving forward and slightly upward, maintain straight lead-leg with slight bend, actively pull lead leg down after clearing
  - Torso and Arms: forward lean to lower COM, opposite arm drives forward parallel to lead leg
- **Trail Leg**: Key to maintain both speed and rhythm through hurdles
  - Pull trail leg through quickly and close to body
  - Focus on driving with knee, keeping heel tight to butt
  - Extend trail leg forward for next stride
  - Minimize lateral movement
  - Faster trail leg = shorter GCT (and consequently, faster time between hurdles)

### Drills and Training
- **Takeoff Drills**: Cut-Step Walk, lead-leg skips
- **Cut-Step Drills**: Wall Cut-Step, Walking Cut-Step, Ankle/Calf Dribbles
- **Hurdle Clearance Drills**: Walking Hurdles, lead-leg drills
- **Trail Leg Drills**: Wall rotation, trail-leg skips
- **Rhythm and Spacing Drills**: 1-Step Drills, 3-Step, 5-Step drills

### Common Mistakes
- Taking off too far from (or too close to) hurdle
- Choppy strides between hurdles
- High hips during clearance ("jumping over")
- Wide trail leg

# Web-Summary

Selwyn Maxwell is a USATF Master Coach specializing in training the intermediate hurdles (300m hurdles), with a comprehensive approach that emphasizes acceleration, speed development, and speed endurance as the keys to success. His event modeling breaks the race into three distinct sections: hurdles 1-3 (adrenaline), hurdles 4-6 (race development), and hurdles 7-8 (capacity). Maxwell's technical elements include specific arm action mechanics for intermediate hurdles, steering practice for maintaining rhythm and spacing, and strength endurance training methods specific to the 300m hurdles. Through his systematic approach to intermediate hurdle training and his understanding of the unique demands of the event, Maxwell has established himself as a leading authority on developing intermediate hurdlers.
