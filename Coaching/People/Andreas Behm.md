# Big Ideas

## Hurdles Philosophy
Altis coach with comprehensive hurdling philosophy.

### Key Concepts
- **Takeoff Spacing** - If you can get proper spacing on takeoff, it cleans things up down the line
  - Often a Perceptual Understanding of "where do I takeoff from?"
  - Give them a Takeoff Mark, then have athlete take 8-12 steps back and *look* for where it is relative to their original perception
- **Younger Hurdlers** - Use as low of a hurdle as you need (and don't be afraid to do that)
  - Discount spacing, make them tighter so athlete can get a *feel* for 3-stepping
  - General thought is practicing over heights that are below comp-height, but there are exceptions
- **Hurdling 2x p/wk** - Start based Session (Short, Technical) + Long-Hurdles Session (more reps)
  - Additionally, doing Speed and Speed-Endurance
- **Talent Identification** - Fast Athletes, Fearless Athletes, Coordinated Athletes
  - Jumpers translate well (in-air coordination), Gymnasts translate well
- **Preparing Young Athletes** - Work on General Coordination (Dribbling, Multijumps) First

### Typical Training: Long-Hurdle Session
- Longer Warmup (45-60min)
- "Bridge Activity" - Bridging warmup into main activity (e.g. dribbles, fast-leg work, switching drills, etc.)
- Hurdle-Drills (3-4 drills p/workout session): Skipping, One-Stepping, Quick Three-Stepping, Approach-Work
- 4-6 Reps of 6-12 Hurdles
  - Wouldn't do say, 5x12 straight - need to factor discount-height, ladder reps (10, 8, 6, etc.)
  - Don't progress athletes unless they're ready - rigid timeline not appropriate

### Sprinters
- **Acceleration Characteristics**: Forward Oriented Torso, Neutral/Aligned Pelvis, Aggressively Scissoring Thighs, Shin Angle - Attacking Back
- **Drills**: Scissoring drills, hip extension/projection (skipping for length)

# Web-Summary

Andreas Behm is an Altis coach with comprehensive hurdling philosophy, emphasizing that if you can get proper spacing on takeoff, it cleans things up down the line (often a perceptual understanding of "where do I takeoff from?"—giving athletes a takeoff mark, then having them take 8-12 steps back and look for where it is relative to their original perception). His approach for younger hurdlers emphasizes using as low of a hurdle as needed (not being afraid to do that), discount spacing to make them tighter so athlete can get a feel for 3-stepping, with general thought of practicing over heights below comp-height (but there are exceptions). Behm's training structure includes hurdling 2x per week (start-based session—short, technical—plus long-hurdles session with more reps), additionally doing speed and speed-endurance. His talent identification recognizes fast athletes, fearless athletes, and coordinated athletes, with jumpers and gymnasts translating well (in-air coordination). His typical training for long-hurdle session includes longer warmup (45-60min), "bridge activity" (bridging warmup into main activity like dribbles, fast-leg work, switching drills), hurdle-drills (3-4 drills per workout session: skipping, one-stepping, quick three-stepping, approach-work), and 4-6 reps of 6-12 hurdles (wouldn't do 5x12 straight—need to factor discount-height, ladder reps like 10, 8, 6, etc., and don't progress athletes unless they're ready—rigid timeline not appropriate). Through his systematic approach to hurdle training and his emphasis on perceptual understanding and progressive development, Behm has established a comprehensive methodology for developing hurdlers.
