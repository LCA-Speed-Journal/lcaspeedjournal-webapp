## Texas A&M Sprint Practices Structure
Overview of sprint practice structure covering training phases and seasonal progression.

### Training Phases
- **Early-Season**: Lot of teaching, not as much "going" - as year progresses, teaching becomes less dense as athletes are starting to just perform
- Understand that normal weekly template needs to shift - understand importance of restoration weeks (spread out density) and deload weeks (post hard-meets, etc.)

### Early-Season (Fall)
Start with high-intensity work right out of gate, just limiting total volume to shorter distances.

#### Accel-Days (Mon)
- Short Accels with MB Pass or other resistance
- Short Accels from 3pt (in flats) - still high-intensity
- Longer Accels on Grass (50m or so) - high-intensity, but sub-max (400m intensity or so)
- Warmdown Series with hurdle-mobility and marching run
- Finish with Strength-Training

#### Tempo-Days (Tue)
- 250s at 84% of 200m best (long-sprints get one more rep than short-sprints)
- Longer Accels from Crouch (50s or so)
- Warmdown with Barefoot Running on Grass and hurdle-mobility

#### Active-Recovery / General Strength Days (Wed)
- Shorter warmups, standing broads, MB throws, strength-training

#### Intensive-Tempo (Thu)

#### MaxV Days (Fri)
- 3-4 Runs for MaxV
- Broken 300s (2x150s on Grass)
- Warmdown with barefoot runs on grass, hurdle mobility, etc.

### Mid-Season (Winter)
- **Accel-Days**: Starting to add spikes in, building distances out to 30s and 40s
- **Tempo-Days**: Building out to things like tempo 200s, 300s, etc.
- **Active-Recovery / General Strength**: Less of broads, more general strength and Med-Ball work
- **Accel #2 (Thurs)**: Contrast Sprints in play now (on straight or on curve)
- **Tempo #2 (Fri)**

### Late-Season (Spring)
- **Transitional Day (Mon)**: Segment runs on Grass - progressive across interval
- **General Strength (Tue)**
- **Acceleration / Intensive Tempo (Wed)**: Group 1 did accel, group 2 did intensive tempo
- **Regeneration Day (Thu)**
- **Pre-Comp (Fri)**

## Acceleration Philosophy
**"There's no such thing as the drive phase. The *entire race* is the drive phase."**

- Think about entire race as continued pushing
- Phases of race exist, yes, but only from perspective of biomechanics
- Within body of athlete, it comes down to **aggressive pushing: the whole time**

# Web-Summary

Vince Anderson is a Texas A&M coach known for his comprehensive sprint practice structure that progresses through early-season, mid-season, and late-season phases with sophisticated periodization. His approach starts with high-intensity work right out of the gate in early-season, limiting total volume to shorter distances while maintaining intensity. Anderson's training structure includes accel-days (short accels with med-ball pass or resistance, short accels from 3-point in flats, longer accels on grass), tempo-days (250s at 84% of 200m best, longer accels from crouch), active-recovery/general strength days, intensive-tempo sessions, and max-velocity days (3-4 runs for maxV, broken 300s). His mid-season progression adds spikes, builds distances out to 30s and 40s, and incorporates contrast sprints. Late-season includes transitional days, general strength, acceleration/intensive tempo, regeneration, and pre-comp sessions. Anderson's acceleration philosophy emphasizes that the entire race is the drive phase, with aggressive pushing throughout rather than distinct biomechanical phases. Through his systematic approach to seasonal progression and his understanding of how to structure training across different phases, Anderson has established a comprehensive framework for sprint development.
