# Big Ideas

## Research-Based Distance Running Insights
Author of "The Science of Running" - providing research-based insights into running performance and training.

## Distance Programming Approach
**Key Distances, Target +1/-1**: Find key distances, then target +1/-1 (similar to [[Joe Rubio]] but different approach)

### Key Concepts
- Research-based approach to distance running training
- Scientific foundation for training decisions
- Similar to Joe Rubio's approach but with distinct methodology
- Focus on finding key distances and targeting adjacent paces

# Publications / Projects
## [[The Science of Running]]
Research-based book providing insights into running performance and training

## Resources:
- [[Distance Programming]]

# Web-Summary

Steve Magness is a renowned running coach and author of "The Science of Running," providing research-based insights into running performance and training. His approach to distance programming emphasizes finding key distances and targeting adjacent paces (+1/-1), similar to Joe Rubio's methodology but with distinct implementation. Magness's work bridges the gap between scientific research and practical coaching application, helping coaches make evidence-based training decisions. His philosophy focuses on understanding the physiological and psychological demands of distance running, with particular attention to how the body responds to different training stimuli. Through his writing and coaching, Magness has become a leading voice in translating exercise science into actionable training principles for distance runners.
