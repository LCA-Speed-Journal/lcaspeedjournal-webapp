Danny Foley is a coach focused on fascial training concepts and methodologies, recognizing the critical role of fascia (connective tissue) in movement, force transmission, and athletic performance. Fascial training emphasizes understanding how connective tissue stores and releases energy, how fascial networks influence movement patterns, and how targeted training can improve fascial health and function. Through his work in fascial training, Foley has contributed to advancing understanding of how connective tissue systems contribute to athletic performance and how they can be specifically trained to enhance movement quality and efficiency.
