## Force-System
Force system framework covering three distinct training days.

### Slow Force Day (A-Day)
Theme: High-Tissue, Low Neural
- Hip ISO: Long, Heavy
- Yielding Press: Slow ECC
- Heavy Push (Bilateral): Hex-Bar, Belt-SQ
- Heavy Pull (Bilateral): RDL
- Med-Ball (Linear) Throws
- Core + Regen

### High Force Day (B-Day)
Theme: Impulse, Braking Power
- Box Depth-Jumps: High-Box for Braking
- Drop-Catches: DB or BB
- OVC ISOs: Joint-Specific
- Heavy Olys or Weighted Jumps
- Med-Ball Rotational Throws
- Reactive Jumps: Landing Focused
- Core + Regen

### Fast Force Day (C-Day)
Theme: High Neural, Elastic
- Ankle ISO: Short GCT
- Oscillations: Hip, Knee
- Drop-Jumps for short GCT
- MB Vertical Throws
- Band-Assisted Jumps

# Web-Summary

Hunter Eisenhower is a coach known for the Force System framework, which organizes training into three distinct training days: Slow Force Day (A-Day) with theme of high-tissue, low neural (hip isometrics, yielding press, heavy push/pull bilateral, med-ball linear throws, core + regen), High Force Day (B-Day) with theme of impulse and braking power (box depth-jumps, drop-catches, OVC isometrics, heavy Olympic lifts or weighted jumps, med-ball rotational throws, reactive jumps with landing focus, core + regen), and Fast Force Day (C-Day) with theme of high neural, elastic (ankle isometrics with short ground contact time, oscillations at hip and knee, drop-jumps for short ground contact time, med-ball vertical throws, band-assisted jumps). Through this systematic organization of training stressors, Eisenhower has established a comprehensive framework for periodizing force development across different neural and tissue demands.
