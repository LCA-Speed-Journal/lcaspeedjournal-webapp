## Jump 101 Training System
Comprehensive training system for jumps covering Long Jump and Triple Jump with detailed concepts, training approaches, and workout programming.

### Mentality
- **Goal Setting**: Set intention, break into long-term and short-term goals
- **Training Gear**: Offseason vs in-season considerations
- **LEAP Philosophy**: Develop → Training → Compete
  - **Develop**: Develop physical body to handle loads
  - **Training**: Train body and mind to work together
  - **Compete**: Showcase talents and perform
- **Training Cycles**:
  - Cycle 1: Muscular and Cardiovascular Endurance
  - Cycle 2: Stationary Plyos and Speed Development
  - Cycle 3: Runway Work, Technique, and Consistency
- **Key Elements**: Hip-Girdle (Key Balance), Soleus (Key to Forward Propulsion), Adductors (Key to Alignment), Abductors (Key to Stability), Back (Key to Posture), Glutes (Key to Movement)

## Long Jump Concepts
### Approach Structure
- **95% of Long-Jump is based on approach**
- **6-Step Approach**: Drive (First 2 Steps), Acceleration (Head Up), Top-End (No more trying to get faster)
- **10-Step Approach**: Drive (4 Step), Top-End
- **14-Step Approach**: Drive (6-Step), Acceleration (Steps 7-10), Top-End (Steps 11-14)
- **18-Step Approach**: Drive (6-Step, head down until step 7), Accel (6-Step, head coming up), Top-End (6-Step, preparing for takeoff)

### Sweet Spot
Not always better to jump to further approach - more speed means less time to match alignment of linear speed with bounce. Need to gauge appropriate approach distance based on how well athlete is timing rhythm off board.

### Long-Jump Entry
- Looking for **big split, attacking down, staying stacked**
- Attacking board with **flat foot**
- Practice Elements: Gallop to Pop-Up, 6-Step Pop-Up

### Riding the Board
Period of time from contact until leaving board - want to delay flight-phase mechanics until you've left board, else overrotation happens.

### Flight Patterns
- Hang
- Hitch

## Triple Jump Concepts
### Approach Distance
Doesn't recommend 18-step approach for triple jump - most schools don't have long enough runway, can bring too much speed into jump (harder to control).

### Entry Techniques
- **Double Arm Entry**: Can take athlete too high off approach - cue "bump" off hips instead for more horizontal projection
- **Single Arm Entry**: Single Over-the-Top - Punch forward, opposite sweeps up and over

### Triple Entry and Posture
- Biggest thing is **consistent position** - Figure-4, Big-Split, Downward-Attack
- Strides need to be consistent - should almost feel "faster" than rest of approach
- Attacking down at board, strong projection outwards, blocking with swing-leg
- Slight lowering of hips on penult, but should strive for "tall" posture
- Cueing to "push the board backwards" to accelerate through takeoff

### Phase Checkpoints
- **Hop Phase**: Beginner athletes will "pogo" takeoff leg instead of extending stride. Emphasize recovery of jump-leg. "Skywalker Effect" - turn block-leg into "drop-leg" after takeoff
- **Step Phase**: Want to use Step Phase like a bound - big split, negative foot-speed. Sweeping opposite leg through
- **Jump Phase**: Similar "sweeping" to step-phase, just not placing stance-leg as far in front of body

## Training for Long Jump
### Bounding
- Developing power, timing, patience, elasticity

### Specific Drills
- Dribble runs
- Dribble runs to pop-up
- Rocket lunges
- Gallops
- Hurdle-hops
- Jump to bungee

## Training Drills for Triple Jump
- Bounding
- Combo bounding (hop-bounds)
- Hop progression drills (standing touch, takeoff projection, hop-recovery, arm drive to takeoff, jogging touch, advanced hop drilling)
- Step phase development (step to jump)
- Jump phase development
- Additional drills

## Training Programs
### Long Jump Workout Programming
- **Warmup**: Stolen from [[Dan Pfaff]] with modifications
- **Training Cycle 1 - Base-Training**: Circuits, tempo running, AMRAP work
- **Training Cycle 2 - Functional-Training**: Plyos (bounds, gallops, power-skips, hurdle-hops), tempo running
- **Training Cycle 3 - Competition Training**: Jumps practice, speed work, plyos, optional strength

### Triple Jump Training Program
- **Warmup**
- **Cycle 1 - Base-Training**: Jump practice, speed work, plyos
- **Cycle 2 - Functional-Training**: Jump practice, speed work, plyos with detailed drill progressions
- **Cycle 3 - Competition Training**: Jump practice, speed work, plyos with specific phase work

# Web-Summary

Keinan Briggs is a jumps coach known for his comprehensive "Jump 101 Training System," which provides detailed methodology for long jump and triple jump development. His approach emphasizes that 95% of long jump performance is based on the approach, with sophisticated understanding of approach distances (6-step, 10-step, 14-step, 18-step) and the critical importance of finding the "sweet spot" between approach length and technical execution. Briggs's philosophy centers on the LEAP framework (Develop → Training → Compete), recognizing that athletes must first develop the physical body to handle loads before training body and mind to work together, ultimately showcasing talents in competition. His training system includes detailed technical components for long jump (approach structure, postural alignment, amplitude of movement, penult and takeoff mechanics, flight patterns, and landing) and triple jump (approach distance, entry techniques, phase checkpoints for hop, step, and jump phases). Briggs's work emphasizes the importance of key muscle groups (hip-girdle, soleus, adductors, abductors, back, glutes) and provides comprehensive drill progressions and workout programming for both events. Through his systematic approach to jumps training, Briggs has established a comprehensive resource for coaches developing jumpers.
