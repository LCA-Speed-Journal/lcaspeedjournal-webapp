## Speed Training Philosophy
TCU Baseball speed training philosophy.

### Organizing Training
**Number 1 Priority**: Need to organize training to *optimize recovery*.
- Don't do speed work after lifting (can flip, but don't lift and then try and sprint)
- You *need* to be sprinting before you lift. Speed is priority, so make it priority
- Lifting is accessory to field-based performance, while speed has direct impact
- Added risk of injury when sprint after lift (particularly hamstring)
- **Manage Athlete-Tension**: Relaxation is key to sprinting fast
  - Cue: run first rep at 95% - if second is slower, lets you know athlete is pushing too hard and tightening up

### Using a High-Low Model
[[Charlie Francis]] was pioneer of this model.
- **High CNS Training Session**: Key Technical Skill Development, High Motor-Unit Recruitment, Axial Loading, Speed and Intent of Movement, Multi-Joint Exercises
- **Low CNS Training Session**: "Just because it's low day doesn't mean it's easy/recovery, it's just going to be different than days we expect high outputs"
- **New Model: Less is More**
  - Monday: Regeneration
  - Tuesday: Speed and Power (+STR-Development)
  - Wed: Off or Regeneration
  - Thursday: Rust-Buster
  - Friday: High-Outputs

### Everything is Holistic
- Ultimately, we're stress-managers
- Never know what athletes are going to be coming in with

### Myth: Team Sport Athletes Rarely Hit Top-Speed
- Old-School programs: not prioritizing speed in early-season, then when time to test 40s, people get hurt
- They incorrectly associate top-speed work with injuries, rather than unpreparedness
- **If you can't do anything else, do 20yd runs** - You'll get to at least 90% speed just doing that
- There's no substitute for sprinting

### 6wk Intervention to Change Sprint Posture
- Day 1 - Dribbles, A-Variations / PVC Runs, Wickets
- Day 2 - Resisted Accels, Pelvic Motor Control
- Day 3 - PVC Runs, High-Speed Wickets

### Sub-Maximal Training Components
- Wickets / MB Runs
- PVC Runs
- Dribbles, Dribble Bleeds into MaxV
- Dribble Tempo-Runs for Posture

### Why Constantly Chase Speed?
- **Frequency is huge component** for training speed
- We know about Training Residuals - max-speed fades fastest
- At TCU, never go full week without at least one day training top-speed

### TCU Acceleration-Progression
- Just buildup distance on build over few weeks (5-10, 10-10, 15-10, 20-10)
- 20-10 is max distance used at TCU
- Repeat progression once hit end, then have block-periodization

Zach Dechant is a TCU Baseball coach known for his speed training philosophy that prioritizes organizing training to optimize recovery, with the fundamental principle that speed work must come before lifting (speed is priority, so make it priority). His approach recognizes that lifting is accessory to field-based performance while speed has direct impact, and there's added risk of injury when sprinting after lifting (particularly hamstring). Dechant's system uses a High-Low model (pioneered by Charlie Francis), with high CNS training sessions focusing on key technical skill development, high motor-unit recruitment, axial loading, speed and intent of movement, and multi-joint exercises, while low CNS sessions are different but not necessarily easy/recovery. His "New Model: Less is More" includes Monday regeneration, Tuesday speed and power (+strength development), Wednesday off or regeneration, Thursday rust-buster, and Friday high-outputs. Dechant challenges the myth that team sport athletes rarely hit top-speed, recognizing that old-school programs not prioritizing speed in early-season lead to injuries when testing 40s, and that the issue is unpreparedness rather than top-speed work itself. His approach emphasizes that "if you can't do anything else, do 20yd runs" (you'll get to at least 90% speed), that there's no substitute for sprinting, and that frequency is a huge component for training speed (max-speed fades fastest, so at TCU they never go full week without at least one day training top-speed). Through his systematic approach to speed training and his emphasis on recovery optimization, Dechant has established a practical framework for team sport speed development.
