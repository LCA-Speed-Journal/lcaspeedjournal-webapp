# Big Ideas

## Jumps Group Changes
Homewood Flossmoor jumps coach for [[Chris Korfist]].

### 2024 Changes to HF Jumps Group
- **Extended Strength/Acceleration Block**: 8 weeks (!!!)
  - Resisted Sprints
  - Post-Practice Strength-Work
  - Post-Meet Strength-Work
- **Sprint-Float-Sprint Emphasis**: For athleticism and rhythm
  - Teaching Sprinters to be Relaxed when Sprinting
  - Build → Max → 90-95% → Max
  - "A well-executed sprint-float-sprint is an elite expression of athleticism"
  - Precision, knowing how to dial back while keeping controlled aggression
  - Rhythm, understanding cadence of sprinting at top versus sub-max

### Shifting Gears and Extending Sprint Distance
- **Shifting Gears is a Skill** - Planned Shifts (400 Pacing) vs Unplanned Shifts
  - Can you shift pace with poise?
  - Sprint-Float-Sprints allow practice of controlled changing of gears

### Sprint-Float-Sprint Progressions
- Start with Flying-Sprints (Fly-10s, Fly-20s)
- Prerequisite: Competition / Speed-Endurance
- Working Athletes towards Sprint-Float Sprints: 6 Key Sessions over 4 Weeks
  - Progressive build from 25-30m – 10m – 10m to 25-30m – 10m – 20m – 20m

### Effective Sprint Cues
- **Build**: Top-Speed by the *end* of the zone
- **Float**: Keep things on Cruise-Control - Arm-Action needs to relax them a little, release some tension
- **Jumpers**: The Float is "Runway Speed"
- **400 Guys**: The Float is "Backstretch Speed"

### General Cues
- **Jaw**: Space between teeth, tongue on roof of mouth, talk (helps relax jaw)
- **Shoulders**: Striking down
- **RPR**: Getting athletes into parasympathetic state
- Don't over-cue too much on form-side - athletes can get overloaded

# Web-Summary

Rob Assisse is a Homewood Flossmoor jumps coach working for Chris Korfist, known for implementing significant changes to the HF jumps group in 2024, including an extended strength/acceleration block of 8 weeks (with resisted sprints, post-practice strength-work, and post-meet strength-work) and sprint-float-sprint emphasis for athleticism and rhythm. His approach recognizes that "a well-executed sprint-float-sprint is an elite expression of athleticism," requiring precision (knowing how to dial back while keeping controlled aggression) and rhythm (understanding cadence of sprinting at top versus sub-max). Assisse emphasizes that "shifting gears is a skill" (planned shifts for 400 pacing vs unplanned shifts), asking whether athletes can shift pace with poise. His sprint-float-sprint progressions start with flying-sprints (fly-10s, fly-20s) as prerequisite (competition/speed-endurance), working athletes towards sprint-float sprints through 6 key sessions over 4 weeks, progressively building from 25-30m – 10m – 10m to 25-30m – 10m – 20m – 20m. His effective sprint cues include "Build" (top-speed by the end of the zone), "Float" (keep things on cruise-control, arm-action needs to relax them a little, release some tension), with jumpers recognizing float as "runway speed" and 400 guys recognizing float as "backstretch speed." Through his innovative approach to jumps training and his integration of sprint-float-sprint work, Assisse has contributed to advancing jumps group methodology.
