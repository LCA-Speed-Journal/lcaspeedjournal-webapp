# Big Ideas

## Speed Development Philosophy
### Core Principles
- **Speed can't develop in a vacuum** - If all you're interested in is the speed workouts, you're not setting yourself up well
- **Most important thing: Prioritize it to Get Better at it** - Need to focus effort on what you want to develop. Organize everything else *around* your priority
- **It's a CNS problem** - Two kids with identical structure and musculature can be vastly different
- **Sometimes, mechanics are tied to pathology** - Needs to be trained out, not cued out (connected to Constraint-Driven Model of coaching)

### Boiling it Down
1. To stimulate the CNS, it needs to be **high-intensity (near-maximal)** - applies to plyos and weights too. Not about how much you do, it's about how intense you do it
2. Understand the **Value of High-Rest** - Facilitate high outputs by being fresh ([[Tony Holler]] motto)
3. Understand the **Value of Low-Volume** - Quality over quantity. Better off doing less at high-quality, versus more at mid-to-low-quality

## Relationship Between Speed and Strength
- Speed is connected to strength as a multiplier
- Get faster, have higher ability to use CNS → have higher ability to activate muscle tissue, drive strength up
- **Work things that are Compatible in the Same Workout** - Group things by Neural Demand:
  - Speed Training, Plyos, Olys, and Major Lifts go together
  - Bodyweight, "fitness," and lower-intensity things go together

## Aerobic and Lactate Considerations
- **High-Lactate stuns the CNS** - Diminishes its effects (neuromuscular irritant) - can't pair it with Speed the next day
- **Surgical use of Lactic-work** - Strike where needed, but never too much
- **Mild-to-moderate Lactate levels** actually improve response to Speed/Power - This much you can do all the time, helps them restore/recover as well
- **Never does Aerobic in isolation** for sprinters/power-athletes - Not a two-way street (anaerobic helps aerobic, but not the other way around). "Never training them under 70%"

## Training for Acceleration
- **40m or Less** to train the Accelerative Capability
- Can get away with incomplete recovery, but still need to be more than 90% recovered
- Reinforces mild-to-moderate lactate theory, adds anabolic effect to the work

## Training for Top-End
- Athletes can hold top-speed for at most **3 seconds** - Usually between 40-70m
- **60m is great drill** for overall development - Lets them accelerate, hold MaxV for couple seconds, then cut rep before things deteriorate
- Likes to do **Sprint-Float-Sprints**

### Stretch-Shortening Cycle
- Drive Up harder, get SSC back into ground harder - and vice-versa

### Adjustments Need to be Made
- "If you want to be a good coach, you need to be a cone-kicker"
- Younger athletes hit maxV earlier, need to shift zones earlier, and vice-versa for elites
- Be prepared to adjust for individuality - the magic isn't in the length, it's in the stimulus

## Speed Endurance
- Not really about endurance, it's about **developing higher levels of specific coordination**
- When things get faster, we make small motor mistakes - more encoded muscle-memory helps smooth this over

## Training Readiness
- Move from **Short-to-Long** across the season
- Allows for early-season to also delay inclusion of Speed Endurance
- "Too many speed programs get ruined by doing speed-endurance right out of the box"

## Weight Training
- **Olympic Lifting enhances transfer**, but *heavy* strength-training tends to reverse the effects
- Don't do Heavy-Lifting and then Speed the next day
- Can pair Heavy-Lifting with Speed on same day (just do speed first)

## Season Periodization
- **Phase 1 = Power-Development**
- **Phase 2 = Quality-Development** (enhancing intensity of plyos, olys, adding more heavy lifting, etc.)
- **In-Season**: Weekly Model
  - Monday is Power-Day (Explosive)
  - Later in Week is Speed Development ("best training") - Wednesday, Thursday, maybe even Friday
  - Connects to [[Racehorse 2]] model - Capacity-Friday, Accel-Monday, Speed-Wednesday

## Plyometric Periodization and Classification
### Philosophy
- Jumps need to be **responsive** - don't want super long GCT
- Think in Terms of **Units** - meant to be main-course, not just salt-and-pepper
- Need to be **Purposeful** - Always Quality over Quantity
- **Load Progressively, then Maintain** - Progression should focus on Quality, not just increasing # of contacts

### Categories
1. **Lower-Leg Conditioning** - Lower-intensity, designed to progress into higher levels
2. **In Place Jumps** - Primary way of establishing initial volumes of moderate-intensity plyos
3. **Short Horizontal Bounds** - Primarily for developing horizontal skill, accel, and COD
4. **Vertical Bounds** - Primarily for vertical skill development, quality of rebounding contacts
5. **Hurdle Hops** - Getting athletes used to changing from static to elastic, vertical skill development, responsivity
6. **Extended Bounds** - Training for sustained force production (good for 400/800m runners)
7. **Box and Depth Jumps** - Higher levels of loading using added height (supramaximal), high-end elastic STR development

## Weight Training to Improve Speed Acquisition
### Understanding Speed and Power
- **Speed is a Neural Quality** - Recruitment, Rate-Coding, and Synchronization/Coordination of Motor-Units
- **Speed Development** - It's about not only What to Do, but also What Not to Do
- Designing and Implementing Effective Speed Development Programming
- Eliminating Obstacles to Speed Acquisition in Other Areas of Program

### Understanding Strength
- **Neural Quality** - Comes from Neuromuscular Integration
- **Improved Neuromuscular Integration** - Prereq for STR-Development, Potentiates STR
- Neuromuscular Integration is Driven by Speed/Power Training

### Managing Intensity
- **High Intensity** is Supported by **Low Density**

### Training by Body-Type
- **Smalls vs Bigs** - Different approaches to weight training list
- Smalls: Limiting the Weight-Training List
- Bigs: Expanding the Weight-Training List (a little)

### Compatible Training Design
- Group by Neuromuscular Demand
- Grouping Neural Agents: Speed, Plyos, and Major-Lifts
- Grouping General Agents: General-STR, Med-Ball, Circuits, General Fitness

### Training Phases
- **Phase 1 - Neuromuscular Integration Improvement**: Improve Rate-Coding and Recruitment
- **Phase 2 - Absolute-STR Development, Power Advancement**: Maintain Contact with Basic Power, Improve Power Production, Achieve Significant Increase in Absolute-STR
- **Phase 3 - In-Season Training Management**: Polarized Approach (Really Intense, or Easy to Recover From)

## Field-Work Approach
### Four Issues
1. **Pathological Gait Problems** - Training Issues, not Teaching Issues
   - Mobility/Flexibility Restrictions, Strength Deficit/Imbalance
   - Answer: Don't overteach, need to tweak training (diverse strength-work, etc.)
   - A lot of these problems is overuse - means you don't need to zero in on drill or two, need varied stimulus
2. **Global Factors** - Posture (Alignment of Head and Pelvis most important), Ranges of Motion, Levels of Stability
3. **Self-Organizing Skills** - Arm-Action (don't need to coach it), Strong Leg vs Coordinated Leg
4. **"Things you Have to Teach"** - Use Global things as Context

### Building Towards Upright
- Cueing to push hard, feeling like climbing steps or ladder
- Not only pushing out, also pushing up - shouldn't have to force posture-change, should be byproduct of driving
- With each push, hips coming further and further through (underneath body)
- Common Athlete Trap: Lifting head/chest up without hips coming as well

### Coaching the Distribution
- "The increase in cadence needs to be patient: if at any time you sacrifice ROM or posture, you've paid too high of a price"
- What might be faster with respect to time, might not *feel* faster to athlete
- Coaches need to focus on things below waist, for most part, and not worry so much about what's happening up top

# Web-Summary

Boo Shexnayder is a highly respected speed development coach whose philosophy centers on the principle that speed is fundamentally a CNS (central nervous system) problem requiring high-intensity, near-maximal training with low volume and high rest periods. His approach emphasizes that speed cannot develop in a vacuum and must be prioritized through compatible training design that groups exercises by neuromuscular demand. Shexnayder's methodology integrates sophisticated understanding of the relationship between speed and strength, recognizing that speed training enhances CNS capacity which in turn drives strength development. He has developed comprehensive systems for plyometric periodization with seven distinct categories, from lower-leg conditioning to box and depth jumps, each serving specific developmental purposes. His field-work approach addresses pathological gait problems through training rather than teaching, emphasizing global factors like posture and self-organizing skills. Shexnayder's training progression moves from short-to-long across the season, with careful attention to the compatibility of training stressors and the critical importance of avoiding high-lactate work that stuns the CNS and diminishes speed development.
