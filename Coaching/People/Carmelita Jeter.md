## Learning About Speed
Missouri State University, Ex-Olympian insights on speed.

### Sprint Mechanics
- **Relaxed and Tall, with Finesse**
- **Finesse**: Floating across top of ground. Motion should be forward, not up and down
  - Efficient, Rhythmic Leg-Action - wheel-like
- **Patience**: Need to exercise patience when executing mechanics - needs to be flow, not robotic
- **Flexibility**: Critical to mastery, also insures athlete against potential injury
  - Hip Mobility is huge

### The Warmup
- Warmup is additional opportunity to work on mechanics and good posture

### The Role of the Coach
- Job to assess athletes, see their potential, and expose them to tools to maximize abilities
- Also need to preserve their health - **Get Them to Starting Line *Healthy***
- Programming needs to meet individual needs of athlete
  - Addressing limiting factors and combine in manner which athlete can round out weaknesses while leveraging strengths
- **Leverage Intuitive-Coaching**

### Coach Jet's Ideal Schedule
- Need 24hr "nothing" before competition, and can't stack too much work in row
- M, T - Practices
- W - Off
- Th, F - Practices
- Sa - Warmup
- Su - Off

# Web-Summary

Carmelita Jeter is a Missouri State University coach and former Olympian known for her insights on speed development, emphasizing that sprint mechanics should be "relaxed and tall, with finesse." Her approach recognizes finesse as floating across the top of the ground with forward motion (not up and down), efficient and rhythmic leg-action that is wheel-like. Jeter emphasizes patience in executing mechanics, recognizing that movement needs to flow rather than be robotic, and that flexibility is critical to mastery and injury prevention, with particular emphasis on hip mobility. Her philosophy recognizes the warmup as an additional opportunity to work on mechanics and good posture. Jeter's approach to coaching emphasizes assessing athletes, seeing their potential, exposing them to tools to maximize abilities, and preserving their health—getting them to the starting line healthy. Her programming meets individual needs of athletes, addressing limiting factors and combining training in a manner that allows athletes to round out weaknesses while leveraging strengths. Jeter leverages intuitive coaching and provides an ideal schedule structure (M/T practices, W off, Th/F practices, Sa warmup, Su off) that ensures 24-hour "nothing" before competition and avoids stacking too much work in a row. Through her experience as an elite athlete and coach, Jeter has established a comprehensive approach to speed development that balances technical excellence with athlete health and individualization.
