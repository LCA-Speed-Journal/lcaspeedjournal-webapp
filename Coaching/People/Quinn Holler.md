## 4x1 Exchanges and Block-Starts
[[Tony Holler]]'s son covering relay and block start techniques.

### Lane Ownership
- Stand 2 Guys Shoulder-to-Shoulder in same lane - there's enough room
- Lane-Position - Curve Runners on Inside, Straightaways on Outside
  - Inside: Right Hand - Outside: Left Hand

### Bang Step and Takeoff Techniques
- Problem with "when he hits tennis ball, you go" - Go is inconsistent
- **Bang Step uses 2 Tennis Balls** - Incoming inside zone, outgoing 1st step is *down* on track
  - 20, 24 steps is "starting zone" - adjust due to speed differences (could be 16-20)
  - Faster Incoming Runner, might need to push zone back step or two

### Drive Phase and Baton Timing
- First 10m is just to drive - big and strong, pushing, not worried about arm
- Younger athletes get too concerned about hand and forget to actually drive out

### Baton Exchanges
- **Outgoing: Stop-Sign** - Thumb is Down, never want hand to sky, want nice big target
- **Incoming: Candlestick** - Upright, 6 to 12, Pushing into hand of outgoing

### Order Strategy and Team-Dynamics
- Big-Guys generally work better on straightaways
- Anchors are most competitive
- Best 2 Guys on straightaways - strongest on 2nd
- 2nd and 3rd leg need to both give/receive - reliability
- Be willing to change order, develop 8-man relay group
- Value opinions of athletes

# Web-Summary

Quinn Holler is Tony Holler's son and a coach specializing in 4x1 relay exchanges and block-start techniques. His approach emphasizes lane ownership strategies, with curve runners on the inside and straightaway runners on the outside, using specific hand positions (inside: right hand, outside: left hand). Holler's "Bang Step" technique uses two tennis balls to create consistent timing for outgoing runners, with the incoming runner entering the zone and the outgoing runner's first step landing on the track. He emphasizes that the first 10 meters is about driving—big and strong, pushing, not worrying about arm action—recognizing that younger athletes often get too concerned about hand position and forget to actually drive out. Holler's baton exchange methodology uses the "Stop-Sign" position for outgoing runners (thumb down, never hand to sky) and "Candlestick" position for incoming runners (upright, 6 to 12, pushing into the hand of outgoing runner). His relay strategy emphasizes that big guys generally work better on straightaways, anchors are most competitive, and the best two guys should be on straightaways with the strongest on the 2nd leg. Through his systematic approach to relay training, Holler has contributed significantly to understanding optimal relay team dynamics and exchange techniques.
