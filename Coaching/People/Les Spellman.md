# Big Ideas

## Universal Speed Rating (USR)
Founder of Universal Speed Rating system - a widely endorsed speed measurement and rating tool used for tracking athlete progress and comparing performance across different contexts. The system provides standardized metrics for evaluating speed capabilities.

## Dynamic Correspondence Theory
Based on [[Yuri Verkhoshansky]]'s concept from the early 90s. To create direct adaptation, training must hit nearly all categories:
- Same Muscle Groups Involved
- Same ROM and Direction of Movement
- Same Type of Muscle-Contraction
- Accentuated Regions of Force Production
- Magnitude of Force, and Duration Applied

**Key Principle**: You need to sprint to get faster at sprinting. Can teach speed, but must be specific with adequate rest.

## Building a Speed System
### Transfer Principles
Specific training means that have transfer to different phases:
- **0-5m**: Resisted Sprints, Explosive Jumps, Olys, Strength-Work (MB Throws and Plyos have medium)
- **5-10m**: Resisted Sprinting, Plyos, Explosive Jumps (MB Throws and Olys have medium)
- **10-20m**: Resisted Sprinting, Plyos (MB Throws, Explosive Jumps have medium)
- **20-30m**: Plyos (MB Throws have medium, Resisted and Explosive Jumps have low)
- **30-40m**: Plyos (medium)

### Training Residuals
- **Maximal Speed declines at 5-7 days** - must sprint weekly or motor control, neuromuscular, and PCr storage all diminish, increasing injury-risk
- Aerobic can have lasting effects for 30+ days
- Minimal effective dose can be achieved in short time frames (5-15min) as part of warmup

### The "Sprinting Vaccine"
Recommendations for safe, effective speed training:
1. Sprint >95% 1x p/wk
2. Build chronic training load of 85% or higher
3. Do thorough warmup and hit high-speed while fresh
4. Rest maximally between intense efforts
5. Increase volume by no more than 5-10% p/wk
6. Sweet spot for reps >85% is 5-8 p/wk
7. Sweet spot for reps >95% is 1-5 p/wk

## Profiling Concepts
### Metrics of Speed (5 Levels)
1. **Lv. 1: MaxV Benchmarking** - Test → Monitor Changes → Compare to Benchmarks
2. **Lv. 2: Accel Profiling** - ID Strengths, Weaknesses → Outcome, Drivers, Strategies → Individualize Program
3. **Lv. 3: Physical Profiling**
4. **Lv. 4: Technical / Stride-Parameters**
5. **Lv. 5: IRA** (Injury Risk Assessment)

### Outcomes, Drivers, and Strategies
- **Outcomes**: Max-Speed, Horizontal Power
- **Drivers**: Power, STR, ROM, Reactivity
- **Strategy**: Sprint-ROM, Frontside-Range, Thigh AngularV, Ground-Speed, TouchdownV, Vertical Stiffness

## Acceleration Development
### Force-Velocity Profiling
- **f0**: Peak horizontal force
- **v0**: Peak horizontal velocity
- **RF**: Ratio of horizontal force at start
- **dRF**: Decrease in horizontal force as velocity increases
- **pMax**: Max-power, in W/kg

### High School Acceleration Structure
- **Early-Accel**: 2-point stance 2-steps, half-kneel 2-steps, 30yd all-out
- **Late-Accel**: March to single/double/triple switch with bounce, 10yd accel; 4-5 steps to 5yd, 7 steps to 10yd, adding extra steps for 20yd total
- **Warmup Structure**: ~15mins with drill-complex, small-group drilling with banded Yuri on sled

### Key Concepts
- **Split Times**: 0-10m (Early Accel), 5-10m (Early-to-Late Accel), 10-20m (Late-Accel/Speed)
- **Airtime**: Critical for acceleration - Step Length vs Stride Length distinction
- **Braking vs Propulsion**: When foot lands in front of body, it's braking, but time after it's under hip, it's propulsive

## Max Velocity Development
### Technical Differences from Acceleration
- **Touchdown**: Minimal braking with quicker contacts and more vertical foot
- **Midstance**: Minimal vertical force, focused on efficient transmission through ground
- **Toe-Off**: Speed maintenance, more passive recoil and elasticity (incomplete extension)

### What Makes People Run Fast?
1. **Generate** massive forces: initially through muscles (co-contractions)
2. **Resist** those forces - Once we hit ground, job is to resist compression and load the tendons/spring
3. **Recycle** Elastic Energy - need to recycle energy loaded into springs
4. **Repeat** the Cycle, Rapidly
5. Maintain Postural **Efficiency** - keep things in alignment, otherwise energy leaks

### Key Technical Elements
- **Creating Maximum Forces in Minimal Times**: Difference between elites and sub-elites is spike in GRF - spiking earlier means steeper initial peak, shortens GCT
- **Thigh-Angular Velocity**: Increase angular velocity increases foot velocity before ground-contact
- **Thigh Block-height**: Want to attack ground from highest point possible - bigger windup, more room to accel into ground
- **Optimal Thigh Angle**: 105° (25-30° backside, 72-80° frontside)

### Form Cues
- **Punch**: Late Flexion - Create big frontside range (72-80°)
- **Attack**: Early Extension - Attack from above, accel foot into ground
- **Rip**: Early-Flexion - Rip foot from ground quickly
- **Push**: Late-Extension - Push ground away fast

### MaxV Drills
- Overhead Drills
- Dribbles (ankle, calf, knee)
- Wickets
- Fly-Sprints
- Sprints

### High School MaxV Structure
- **Curve-Running**: Competing 1v1 (facing opposite directions)
- **Speed-Prep Drills**: Toe-up prime-times, switches, dribbles, wickets
- **Fly-Zone Work**: Building out from 10yd to 20yd to 30yd with timing benchmarks

## Speed Endurance Protocols
Training menus for developing speed endurance with specific rep schemes and distances. Focus on maintaining high-quality outputs over extended distances (80-150m per rep, 300-900m total volume).

## Eccentric Forces and Athlete Profiling
### Measuring Eccentric RFD
- **20% Higher in Premier League vs Championship** - Jump height was only 2.6% difference
- Eccentric RFD is separating factor between elite and sub-elite
- **Early-Accel**: Primarily propulsive (CON-dominant), less impact of braking phase
- **Late-Accel, MaxV**: More braking-intensive (essentially first half of total contact)

## Separating Groups by Deficiency
Breaking into groups relative to High/Low Force Deficient and High/Low Velocity Deficient:

### Group 0 (Special): Very Poor Accel — <50% RF
- 60% vDec Push, 5-10yds, 8-10 Reps
- Increase force capability towards early-accel

### Group 1: Strength-Speed — >50% RF, Tau 1.1+
- 50% vDec Shoulder, 15-20yds, 6-8 Reps
- Power emphasis, increase force capability in late-accel

### Group 2: Power — >50% RF, Tau 1-1.1
- 50% vDec Waist, 15-20yds, 6-8 Reps
- Power emphasis, increase force capability in late-accel

### Group 3: Speed-Strength — >50% RF, Tau 0.9-1.1
- 25% vDec Waist, 20-25yds, 4-6 Reps
- Speed-STR emphasis, increase force capability at high-speed

### Group 4: Velocity — >50% RF, Tau 0.9-1
- 5-10% vDec Waist (can also do overspeed or free-running), 30yds, 3-5 Reps
- Technical emphasis, high-V without interrupting mechanics

## Injury Risk Mitigation
### Assessment
- **ROM**: Range, Asymmetry - Low-range is red-flag
- **Lumbo-Pelvic Control**: Kickback Score, Asymmetry - Low-score is red-flag
- **Sprint-Work**: FVP, Force-Imbalance - Low-Force is red-flag

### Intervention
- Add extra mobility if red-flags, but all athletes take preventative measures
- **Strength-Exposures for all athletes**: Hip (0-60°, 60-90°, 90-110°), Hamstring (hip over knee, knee over hip, stiffness at knee/hip)

# Web-Summary

Les Spellman is the founder of the Universal Speed Rating (USR) system, a widely endorsed speed measurement and rating tool used for tracking athlete progress and comparing performance across different contexts. His training philosophy is grounded in Dynamic Correspondence Theory, based on Yuri Verkhoshansky's concept, which emphasizes that to create direct adaptation, training must match the specific demands of sprinting across multiple dimensions including muscle groups, range of motion, contraction type, and force application. Spellman's "Sprinting Vaccine" approach provides evidence-based recommendations for safe, effective speed training, emphasizing that maximal speed declines at 5-7 days and must be trained weekly. He has developed comprehensive profiling systems with five levels of speed metrics, from basic max-velocity benchmarking to sophisticated injury risk assessment. Spellman's work includes detailed force-velocity profiling for acceleration development, technical analysis of max-velocity mechanics emphasizing the "Punch, Attack, Rip, Push" sequence, and innovative grouping strategies that separate athletes by deficiency (force vs velocity) to individualize training. Through his Certified Speed and Agility Coach (CSAC) course, he has established a comprehensive system for speed development that integrates scientific principles with practical coaching application.
