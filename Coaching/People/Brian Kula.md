# Big Ideas

## Speed Priority Program Design
TFC '25 presentation on speed priority program design.

### Core Philosophy
- **Energy towards high-proficiency in small number of areas**
- "Believe and Trust in What You Do"
- **Long Term**: As much culture as it is Program Design

### Key Concepts
- **Push > Pull** - Strike Down and Back
- **Loaded Foot** - Dorsiflexion, Stiffness
- **Load > Land** - Swing Recovery, Front-Side Mechanics
- **Negative Foot-Speed** - Tearing the Track/Turf (see also [[Ken Clark]])
- **"Running on the Sun"** - Need to get off the ground quickly

### Structure Themes
- **Accel/Decel**: Horizontal, Longer-GCT, Hip Projection, Strength-Speed
- **MaxV**: Vertical, Shorter-GCT

### Rough Session Outline
Warmup → Mechanics and Form → Speed Application → Test/Data → Power/STR

### Influences
- [[Tony Wells]] (Colorado Flyers) - in a Rec Center
- [[Charlie Francis]]
- [[Karim Abdel Wahab]] (Georgia) - Speed-Development, Max Velocity
- [[Barry Ross]] - [[Underground Secrets to Running Faster]]

### Training Pieces
- **Heavy Accelerations** (a big rock with Kula)

## Bounce Fire Series
Video series on bounce fire drills with Part 1 and Part 2 links and presentation reference for developing reactive strength and elastic qualities.

# Web-Summary

Brian Kula is a speed coach known for his "Speed Priority Program Design" philosophy, which emphasizes directing energy towards high-proficiency in a small number of areas with the belief that "as much culture as it is Program Design." His approach centers on key concepts like "Push > Pull" (striking down and back), "Loaded Foot" (dorsiflexion and stiffness), "Load > Land" (swing recovery and front-side mechanics), "Negative Foot-Speed" (tearing the track/turf), and "Running on the Sun" (getting off the ground quickly). Kula's training structure distinguishes between acceleration/deceleration themes (horizontal, longer ground contact time, hip projection, strength-speed) and max-velocity themes (vertical, shorter ground contact time). His Bounce Fire series provides drills for developing reactive strength and elastic qualities. Kula's influences include Tony Wells (Colorado Flyers), Charlie Francis, Karim Abdel Wahab (Georgia), and Barry Ross, demonstrating his integration of diverse speed training perspectives. Through his Track Football Consortium presentations and his systematic approach to speed development, Kula has established himself as a leading voice in speed-priority training methodology.
