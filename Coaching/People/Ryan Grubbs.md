# Big Ideas

## Neuromuscular Framework for Speed and Rehab
Houston Texans neuromuscular framework.

### Core Philosophy
- **Good Rehab is Good Training** (regardless of if we call it "Rehab" or "Performance")
- Lifting Weights, Periodization is more than just Manipulating Load & Avg. Velocity

## Four-Phase Return-to-Field Protocol (Hamstring Example)
- **Return to Field**: Making sure Pain is Submaximal, Nord-Board Screening is 50-70%, Upper-Body Lifting, Re-Introducing Lower-Body on uninjured leg
- **Load-Introduction**: Nord-Board (Prone ISO), Force-Deck screening within 30% between legs, Beginning 50% Volume of Accel/Decel, Tempo-Work, Low-Intensity COD
- **Reconditioning**: Screenings within 20% between legs, 75-100% Total Volume, bringing High-Speed up to 75%, "Speed and Power-First Mindset"
- **Football Performance**: Screenings within 15% between legs, Matching Game-Demands with Volume

## 4 Layers of Rehab Framework
1. **Wire the CNS, Remodel Tissue** to apply Large Forces thru Limbs (Gym-Work)
2. **Tie Up any Energy-Leaks** causing Friction (Tissue-Specific)
3. **Intentional about *how* tissues are loading** (Movement-Analysis, Kinematics)
4. **Prepping the Athlete to be Robust** (thrive under demands of sport)

## Periodizing Variables over Blocks
### Loaded Gym-Based
- **Time to Peak-Velocity (Rate)**
  - [[Randy Huntington]] Reference - Onset of CON-Phase to Moment of Peak CON-Velo
  - Looking to Increase Time-to-PeakV by Enhancing ECC-RFD
  - "Performance-Zone" - 200-400ms Window around Late-ECC to Early-CON Phases
- **Load (Force)**

### Plyo Patterns
- GCT (Rate)
- Ground Reaction Forces (Force)

### General Ideas
- Time to Peak Velocity: Slow to Fast
- GCT: Long to Short
- CON & ECC Peak-Power: Low to High
- Ground Reaction Forces: Low-to-High
- ECC Velocity: Slow to Fast

## Getting Faster Time to Peak-Velo
### Full-ROM Advantages
- Greater Mean and Peak ECC/CON Velocity
- Greater Time-Under-Tension
- Greater Glute-Max
- **Advice**: Lower %1RM, Replace with Band/Air-Resist for more ECC/CON Velocity

### Partial-ROM Advantages
- Faster Time to Peak-Velo
- Faster ECC/CON Accelerations
- **Advice**: Increase-Load and Shorten ROM for more ECC/CON Acceleration

## Eccentric RFD
Critical for high-quality CON-Accelerations
- Goal = Move High-Load + Rapid ECC-Velo + Short Time to Peak-Velo

## Block 0 Programming
Goal: train soft-tissue (muscle & tendon) to be able to pull force appropriately.
- ISOs (10-30s Yielding ISOs)
- EQI's (30-45s ECC Lowering)
- Slow and Heavy ECC (5-8s lowering)

## Tissue-Specific Gym-Work (Energy-Leaks)
### Hamstring
- ISOs, Slow-STR, Power, Dynamic, Plyo, Movement (Sprinting Kinematics using [[VueMotion]] → [[Jonas Dodoo]])

### Ankle
- ISO, Slow-STR, Power, Dynamic, Plyo, Movement

### Knee
- ISO, Slow-STR, Power, Dynamic, Plyo, Movement

# Web-Summary

Ryan Grubbs is a Houston Texans coach known for his neuromuscular framework for speed and rehabilitation, with the core philosophy that "good rehab is good training" regardless of whether it's called rehab or performance. His four-phase return-to-field protocol (using hamstring as example) progresses from return to field (ensuring pain is submaximal, Nord-board screening at 50-70%, upper-body lifting, re-introducing lower-body on uninjured leg) through load-introduction, reconditioning, and football performance phases. Grubbs's framework includes four layers: wiring the CNS and remodeling tissue to apply large forces through limbs (gym-work), tying up energy leaks causing friction (tissue-specific), being intentional about how tissues are loading (movement-analysis, kinematics), and prepping the athlete to be robust (thriving under sport demands). His periodization approach focuses on time to peak-velocity (rate), load (force), ground contact time (rate), ground reaction forces (force), and eccentric RFD, with sophisticated understanding of how to progress from slow to fast, long to short ground contact times, and low to high forces. Through his integration of rehabilitation and performance principles, Grubbs has established a comprehensive approach to athlete development and return-to-play protocols.
