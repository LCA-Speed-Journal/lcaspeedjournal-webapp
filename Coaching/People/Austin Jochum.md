## Play-Oriented Warmups
From [[+Sprints Programming]] - warmup approach emphasizing play and movement games rather than rigid structure.

# Web-Summary

Austin Jochum is a coach who emphasizes play-based training and movement games as foundational to athletic development, hosting the Jochum Strength Podcast and creating the Building Better Movers program. His philosophy centers on "Play is King," recognizing that play-oriented warmups and movement games provide essential foundations for athletic development while avoiding the "training whiplash" that can come from constantly switching frameworks. Jochum's approach includes specific attention to ball and socket joint training (hips and shoulders), using exercises like weighted arm circles and banded external/internal rotation to train joints in ways their shape was meant to move. His work warns against both extremes: excessive neuroticism and analysis paralysis on one hand, and "making stuff up" or being only a meathead on the other. Through his podcast and programs, Jochum has established himself as a leading voice in movement-based training, emphasizing natural movement patterns and the importance of maintaining a coaching culture rather than constantly bouncing between frameworks.
