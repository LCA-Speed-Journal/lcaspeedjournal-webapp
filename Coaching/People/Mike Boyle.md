# Big Ideas

## Facility Management
Strength and conditioning coach known for facility management and training system development.

### Key Concepts
- Big Multijoint movements - 1-2x p/wk at least
- Knee-Hinge (Squat-Patterns, DL can count)
- Front-Squat until 1.3x BW, then earn right to Back-Squat
- Bilateral and Unilateral Work
- Frontal-Plane (Lunging, Good-Morning)
- Horizontal Pressing / Vertical Pressing
- Few more pulling patterns than pushing patterns
- Shoulder Complex
- Rotational Core-Work
- Posterior Chain
- Ankle/Foot Complex

# Web-Summary

Mike Boyle is a renowned strength and conditioning coach known for facility management and training system development, with his systematic approach influencing numerous coaches including Kevin Carr and Adam Vogel. His training system emphasizes big multijoint movements (1-2x per week at least), knee-hinge patterns (squat-patterns, deadlift can count), front-squat until 1.3x bodyweight then earning right to back-squat, bilateral and unilateral work, frontal-plane work (lunging, good-morning), horizontal and vertical pressing, more pulling patterns than pushing patterns, shoulder complex, rotational core-work, posterior chain, and ankle/foot complex. Through his systematic approach to training organization and his work in facility management, Boyle has established foundational principles for group training and facility operations that have become industry standards, with particular emphasis on progressive movement patterns, injury prevention, and systematic strength development.
