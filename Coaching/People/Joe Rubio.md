## Principles of Elite 1500m Training
Systematic breakdown of how to build an elite miler, covering training theory, physiological demands, and annual training plan structure.

### Key Physiological Demands
**Energy Breakdown for the 1500m:**
- Aerobic: 76%
- Anaerobic: 22%
- Phosphate (ATP/PCr): ~2%

### Training Types
**Conditioning Paces:**
- **Aerobic Conditioning**: Easy to moderately paced sustained runs of 30-120 minutes at 55-75% VO2max (warm-up jog to everyday conversational pace)
- **Anaerobic Conditioning**: 15-25 minute efforts at 75-90% VO2max (slightly slower than marathon race pace down to 10k race pace - tempo or steady state runs)

**Capacity Paces:**
- **Aerobic Capacity**: 2-8 minute reps at 90-100% VO2max (between 10k/tempo and just faster than 5k pace - interval workouts or fartlek runs)
- **Anaerobic Capacity**: 30-120 second reps at better than 100% VO2max (roughly mile to two-mile race pace - "speed work")

### Percentage Breakdown of Training Plan
- **Conditioning: 65%** — Aerobic (endurance): 45% — Anaerobic: 20%
- **Capacity: 30%** — Aerobic: 20% — Anaerobic: 10%
- **Phosphates: 5%**

**Key Insight**: 85% of training comes from aerobic paced training.

### Training Theory
**Weekly Paces: Training Above/Below**
- When we have a "primary" training pace, structure week to target areas just above and just below
- 3 efforts per week: one at primary, one below primary, one above primary
- **Summer/Fall**: 5k (Secondaries: Tempo & 3k)
- **Winter**: 3k (Secondaries: 5k & 1500m)
- **Spring**: 1500m (Secondaries: 3k & 800m)

**Bi-weekly Schedule**: ±1 pace on Week-1, ±2 paces on Week-2, allowing each block to cover primary pace and four adjacent paces 1-2x in training block (full cycle every 6 workouts)

**Training Volume**: Set mileage goals at beginning of training year, deviate only minimally throughout year. Over subsequent years, mileage expands, but within given year, workouts split up reps/sets enough that total mileage doesn't exceed athlete's given volume.

**One Main Workout**: Rubio leans into "one primary effort p/wk," letting other workouts serve as maintenance of other qualities. Primary workout should be day that makes athlete feel a bit nervous.

**Don't Raise Mileage and Intensity Together**: One of biggest mistakes - attempting new weekly mileage PR's while maintaining 2-3 times weekly track sessions. Start with raising mileage (summer/early fall), then increase intensity once adapted to mileage.

### Key Concept: Develop as "Distance Runner" First
"We should always start competitive 1500 training by becoming a competitive distance runner first. We must develop the aerobic and anaerobic conditioning aspects as well as the aerobic capacity component to the highest levels possible for the current season and each successive season afterwards before we will see any significant performance gains made by incorporating a large volume of anaerobic capacity work, aka speed-work."

### The True Base: Following Xmas Break
Following small break after XC Fall Nationals is when we start concerning ourselves with pace of runs away from track. The 8-10 weeks following Christmas break is really the true base phase - all about higher volume of weekly miles completed at faster aerobic paces approaching 70-75% VO2max.

## Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn
Used at multiple points in training year, depending on pacing:
- **Summer**: Not leveraged
- **Fall**: Speed-maintenance with higher volume
- **Winter**: Speed-maintenance work
- **Spring**: Warmup component on speed-focused days (400, 800, 1500 paced)

**Structure**: Continuous effort where athlete strides the straightaway and jogs the turn, with pacing based on phase:
- Early-Fall: 2400m - Untimed strides, first few @ 3k, middle ones @ Mile, last 1-2 @ 800m
- Late-Fall/Winter: 1200m - 2 @ 3k, 2 @ Mile, 2 @ 800m
- Spring: Intermediate step between progressive opener and more rep-oriented cutdowns to end warmup

**Purpose**: Rubio's version of progressive strides, but encapsulated into more continuous effort. Similar to Jay Johnson's strides-progression but more structured and track-based.

## Distance Programming Approach
**Key Distances, Target +1/-1**: Find key distances, then target +1/-1 (similar to [[Steve Magness]] but different approach)

### Extended Warmups
Main ideas:
- Begin workout with **moderate run** (either straight or progressive)
- Warmup gets **faster and faster**, funneling towards workout pace
- Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn into more focused efforts
- Strides into progressive accelerations

**Warmup A (All-Out, 400, 800, or Mile Workouts)**:
1. 20 min progressive run (10 min easy, 5 at AE, 5 at tempo)
2. 1200-1600 of stride the straight/jog turn
3. 1 x 150-200 at 1500 pace
4. 1 x 150-200 at 800 pace
5. 1 x 150 acceleration (1500/800/400)
6. 1 x 150 Sprint/Float/Sprint (400/800/400)
7. 5-10 minutes, then proceed with scheduled workout

**Warmup B (5k, 10k, or Tempo Workouts)**:
1. 25-30 min easy
2. 4 x 80-100 light strides
3. 6-8 x 120 diagonal accelerations (1500/800/400) on grass field, walk across recovery
4. 5-10 minutes, then proceed with workouts

# Web-Summary

Joe Rubio is a highly respected distance running coach known for his "Principles of Elite 1500m Training" methodology, which provides a systematic breakdown of how to build elite milers through comprehensive training theory, physiological understanding, and structured annual training plans. His approach emphasizes that 85% of training comes from aerobic-paced work, with a detailed breakdown of conditioning paces (aerobic and anaerobic) and capacity paces (aerobic and anaerobic capacity). Rubio's philosophy centers on developing athletes as "distance runners first" before specializing, with careful attention to weekly pacing strategies that target primary paces and adjacent speeds. His system includes innovative warmup structures like "Stride-the-Straight, Jog-the-Turn" and extended warmups that progressively funnel athletes toward workout pace. Rubio's methodology emphasizes one primary workout per week, careful volume management, and the critical principle of never raising mileage and intensity together, making him a leading authority on middle-distance training.
