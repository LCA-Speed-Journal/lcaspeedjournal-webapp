## Program Design for Jumpers-Sprinters
Brown University, 2x Olympian program design for athletes transitioning between jumping and sprinting.

### Transitioning
- **Sprinter to Jumper**: Faster, Sprint Mechanics, Top-End
  - Challenges: Learning new Tech and Different Performance Focus
- **Jumper to Sprinter**: Explosive, Skill Development, Body Control, and Flexibility
  - Generally seen as easier shift: pre-existing sprint experience, comparable accel, overlapping training

### The Importance of Speed
- Improves Runway Approach
- Better Force Application
- Reduced Braking Forces (Better Triple-Phases)

### Training Phases
- **General Prep**: Overall Fitness, Sprint Mechanics, Minor Technical Training, Weight-Training Techniques and Strength, Flexibility and Mobility
- **Specific Prep**: 
  - Jumpers - Approach Consistency, Rhythm; Refine Jumping Tech
  - Sprinters - Accel and Speed Endurance, Coordination and Force-Application
  - Both - Reactive Strength, Elasticity, Anaerobic Power, Weight-Room Strength
- **Pre-Comp**: Fine-Tuning, Assessing Readiness, Event-Specific Strategies, Balance Training Load and Recovery
- **Comp/Championship-Phase**: Peak Performance, Maintain Conditioning, Execute under Pressure

# Web-Summary

Damar Forbes is a Brown University coach and 2x Olympian specializing in program design for athletes transitioning between jumping and sprinting. His approach recognizes that sprinters transitioning to jumpers bring speed, sprint mechanics, and top-end ability but face challenges in learning new technique and different performance focus, while jumpers transitioning to sprinters bring explosiveness, skill development, body control, and flexibility, with the transition generally seen as easier due to pre-existing sprint experience. Forbes emphasizes that speed improves runway approach, enables better force application, and reduces braking forces (better triple phases). His training phases progress from general prep (overall fitness, sprint mechanics, minor technical training, weight-training techniques and strength, flexibility and mobility) through specific prep (approach consistency and rhythm for jumpers, accel and speed endurance for sprinters, reactive strength and elasticity for both) to pre-comp (fine-tuning, assessing readiness, event-specific strategies, balancing training load and recovery) and comp/championship phases (peak performance, maintaining conditioning, executing under pressure). Through his systematic approach to dual-event development, Forbes has established a comprehensive framework for coaches working with athletes in both jumping and sprinting events.
