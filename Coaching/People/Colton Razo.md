## S&C Framework of Training Stressors
Ohio State framework covering comprehensive training stressor organization.

### But Why?
Strong working model of training categorizations allows for:
- Continual Innovation
- Versatility
- Ability to see other ways of thinking
- Clearer guidelines emerge after properly consolidating stressors

### Influences
- Influenced by [[Boo Shexnayder]]
- Influences from old Soviet Systems [[Verkoshansky]], etc.

## Governing Laws of Thinking
### Overload Principle
Detraining → retaining → stimulating.
- Need sufficient recovery between similar CNS-Intensive Stressors
- Need to allocate sufficient volume and intensity to yield improvements

### Law of Accommodation
SAID Principle.
- Need to use general, general specific, and specific training means

### Law of Specificity
To get better at task, you need to do that specific task

### Law of Individualization
Each organism is going to have unique response to given training stressor
- Classify athletes based on individual physical preparedness - will dictate appropriate training means

## Categorization of Exercise
(see [[Bondarchuk]] and his description of these things)

### General Preparatory Exercises (GPE)
Do not imitate competitive event, do not train specific systems.
- Very all-purpose, used for general coordination and recovery
- Bodyweight work, calisthenics, etc
- A lot of low-hanging fruit here

### Specific Preparatory Exercises (SPE)
Do not imitate movement, but train same major muscle groups and psychological systems.
- Example: Throws, Sprints, and Jumps
- Olympic Lifts
- Max-STR and Special-STR (Explosive-Jumps and Med-Ball work)

### Specific Development Exercises (SDE)
Exercises that repeat competitive event in training, but in its separate parts.
- Example 1: Triple Jumpers - Bounding Exercises (with or without load)
- Example 2: Discus Throwers - Stand Throws
- Example 3: Endurance - Hill Work / Hill-Sprints

### Competitive Exercises (CE)
Exercises (any activities done in training) that are identical, or almost identical, to competition event.
- Example 1: Triple Jumpers - Full-Jumps (varied approach length)
- Example 2: Shotput Throwers - Full-Throws (glide or spin)
- Example 3: Sprinters - various forms of sprint work (accels, flys)

## Definable Strength Qualities
- **Absolute STR** - How much contractile force individual can display
- **Accelerative STR** - Moving submax load with high-speed (force production over given distance, when time is constraint)
- **Starting STR** - Force generated instantaneously/prior to external movement
- **Explosive STR** - Ability to produce max-force in shortest possible time
- **STR-Endurance** - Ability to sustain outputs against external load

## Exercise Prescription Continuum
### Max-Effort Method (85% or more)
- Primarily trains absolute strength
- Aiming to increase absolute-STR or max ISO-STR
- General Force-Capacity
- General Markers: 1.8-2.0x BW Squat (1.4-1.6x BW for females)

### Dynamic-Effort Method (under 70%)
- Primarily trains accel-STR and subcategories of STR-Speed and Speed-STR
- Aim to increase RFD
- Increase transfer from general force-capacity to more explosive work
- Key driver of peak power output development
- Peak Power output happens with 30-60% 1RM (velocities of 0.75-1.3 m/s)
- Peak power output for Oly-Lifting happens at 75-85% 1RM

### Repetition Effort Method
- Primarily trains STR-Endurance and acts as tissue-prep
- Increasing muscular hypertrophy

## Conjugation
Working to train all qualities/categorizations at all times (just adjusting volume to accommodate)
- Example programs for Jumps Group and Throws Group showing conjugation approach

# Web-Summary

Colton Razo is an Ohio State coach known for his comprehensive S&C framework of training stressors, influenced by Boo Shexnayder and old Soviet systems like Verkhoshansky. His approach organizes training through governing laws: the Overload Principle (detraining → retaining → stimulating, requiring sufficient recovery between similar CNS-intensive stressors), the Law of Accommodation (SAID principle, requiring general, general-specific, and specific training means), the Law of Specificity (to get better at a task, you need to do that specific task), and the Law of Individualization (each organism has unique response to training stressors). Razo categorizes exercises into General Preparatory Exercises (GPE), Specific Preparatory Exercises (SPE), Specific Development Exercises (SDE), and Competitive Exercises (CE). His exercise prescription continuum includes Max-Effort Method (85% or more, primarily trains absolute strength), Dynamic-Effort Method (under 70%, primarily trains accelerative strength and RFD), and Repetition Effort Method (primarily trains strength-endurance and acts as tissue prep). Through conjugation (working to train all qualities at all times, just adjusting volume), Razo has established a comprehensive framework for organizing training stressors across different athletic qualities.
