## General Approach for Speed & Power Development
University of Miami approach starting with needs analysis.

### Starting with Needs Analysis
- **Every Sport is Different**:
  - Comp Schedule, Position/Event
  - Kinematics - running, jumping, throwing, etc
  - Kinetics - peak-force, RFD, ECC-RFD, impulse, GCT, peak-power output, etc
  - Common Injuries
- **Aerobic vs Anaerobic Components**:
  - Aerobic - HR (Avg and Max), Total Distance Covered p/game or event
  - Anaerobic - sprint volume, COD, accels/decels

### Power Development
- **Sprinting, Jumping, Throwing** - The General Basics
- **Power-Oriented Lifting** - Olympic Lifts
  - Power → Hang → Floor - can also do from blocks
  - Pull → High-Pull → Muscle-Clean → Clean

# Web-Summary

Arianna Luther is a University of Miami coach known for her general approach to speed and power development, starting with comprehensive needs analysis that recognizes every sport is different (comp schedule, position/event, kinematics like running/jumping/throwing, kinetics like peak-force/RFD/eccentric-RFD/impulse/ground-contact-time/peak-power-output, common injuries) and aerobic vs anaerobic components (aerobic: HR avg and max, total distance covered per game or event; anaerobic: sprint volume, change of direction, accelerations/decelerations). Her power development approach emphasizes sprinting, jumping, and throwing as the general basics, with power-oriented lifting through Olympic lifts (power → hang → floor, can also do from blocks; pull → high-pull → muscle-clean → clean). Through her systematic needs analysis approach and her integration of multiple training modalities, Luther has established a comprehensive framework for developing speed and power across different sports and athletic contexts.
