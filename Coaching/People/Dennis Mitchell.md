## LILA Speed Masterclass
LILA speed masterclass covering physicality and block start mechanics.

### Physicality as Foundational Piece
- **90% of the time, going to start here** - Have to be physically able to perform task
- Often, coaches forget how physical task is to do well (from angle-perspective)
- Dennis targets this in weight-room as well as on track
- **Focuses on loading the muscle, not necessarily load**
- High bias to unilateral work, not lot of movements trained past 90°
- **High volume of sled-pulls**, aiming for lower-angles. Long-duration per rep (50-60m)
- Also *push* sleds, emphasizing striking pattern (since it cuts down on overstriding)

### First Push out of Blocks
- **First 15-30m is "the Drive"**
- Dennis doesn't see as power-component. That's built before tech, through setup
- Vertical and Horizontal Movement: Lower they come out, more power they're naturally creating
- Can be indicative of strength-deficiency if athlete comes out high

### Testing Angles
- Dennis tells athletes to "test the angles"
- Asks them to shoot low, then just focus on "running away from block" rather than "powering away"
- **Warning**: [[Tony Holler]] and [[Chris Korfist]] Conflict - Cueing athlete low can lead to breaking at waist
- For those who feel like stumbling when shooting low, need to cycle under faster to hold balance
- **Need to meet that low-angle with faster speed underneath**

# Web-Summary

Dennis Mitchell is a coach known for his LILA Speed Masterclass covering physicality and block start mechanics, with the foundational principle that 90% of the time, training must start with physical capability—athletes must be physically able to perform the task. His approach focuses on "loading the muscle, not necessarily load," with high bias to unilateral work and high volume of sled-pulls (aiming for lower angles, long-duration per rep of 50-60m) and also pushing sleds to emphasize striking pattern (cutting down on overstriding). Mitchell's philosophy recognizes that the first 15-30m is "the Drive," which he doesn't see as a power component but rather something built before technique through setup, with vertical and horizontal movement creating more power when athletes come out lower (which can be indicative of strength-deficiency if they come out high). His "testing angles" approach asks athletes to shoot low and focus on "running away from block" rather than "powering away," with recognition that cueing athletes low can lead to breaking at waist (conflict with Tony Holler and Chris Korfist approaches), requiring faster cycling underneath to hold balance and meet low-angle with faster speed underneath. Through his emphasis on physicality as foundation and his systematic approach to block starts, Mitchell has established a methodology that prioritizes strength and physical preparation before technical refinement.
