# Big Ideas

## Top-Speed Training Science
West Chester University researcher and coach specializing in top-speed training science and force application research.

### The Science of Top-Speed
- By **20m, almost all athletes (including pros) are ~90% of maxV**
- Peak Velocity (maxV) can be as late as **40-70m**, but upright mechanics may begin as early as **16-18m**
- Training Implications: Will be training upright mechanics even when sprint is 20-30m - just differing with regards to amount of *time* spent utilizing those mechanics

### Distinguishing Characteristics of Phases
- **Start (0-2 Steps)**: Longest GCT, shortest flight-times, forward-leaning posture, forward-angled vector
- **Transition (5-20m, Steps 3-13ish)**: Intermediate GCT and flight-time, posture/vector getting upright
- **Top-Speed**: Short GCT, longer flight-times, upright posture and vertical force-vector

### Ground-Contact Geometry
- **Force *tangent* to the ground**, not necessarily just vertical force, is the big thing to think about
- **Contact-Excursion Angle**: Total angle swept by leg during ground-contact phase (usually 50-60deg, or 1rad)
- **Contact Distance**: Forward distance traveled by COM during ground contact phase (usually ~ leg length, 1m)

### GCT and Running Speed
- **Speed = Contact Distance / Contact Time**
- Since contact distance is generally same, faster speeds are correlated with shorter contact times
- **Vertical Impulse**: Avg. Vertical Force * Contact Time
- **Faster Speed largely connected to greater *rate* of vertical force application**
- Greater spike in initial component of contact
- Connected to ankle stiffness: striking ground hard with efficient amount of return

### Thigh Angular Motion
- Comparing thigh angular motion between team-sport and elite sprinters:
  - Oscillation more symmetrical: team-sport has more backside-ROM
  - Increased amplitude, particularly on flexion-side (more front-side)
  - Faster frequency, and sharper angular acceleration
- **Clark-105** (as popularized by [[Cal Dietz]]): Optimal thigh angle concept
- **Two Mass Model**: Lower-leg has separate impulse from rest of body, higher impulse with "whipping" of lower-leg connected to higher max-velocities

### Fast Top-Speed Equation
**Fast Thigh Angular-Velo → Fast Foot-Touchdown Velo + Stiff Ground Contact → High Rate of vForce**

### Top-Speed Mechanics: Bounce, Scissor, Strike
- Runner should appear to **"Bounce"** so there's enough lift to attack ground
- Legs should aggressively **"Scissor"** with rapid reversal
- Front-Leg should forcefully **"Strike"** the ground
- Need **Torsional Stiffness during Flight-Phase**, and **Vertical Stiffness on Contact**

### Force Application Research
- **Higher initial spike in force into the ground** shown in elite sprinters (as referenced in [[What We Really Know about Speed & Power]])
- Orientation of Force into Ground is primary determinant of running speed
- For elite sprinters, they apply force into ground in different manner than regular people

### Whip From the Hip
(As referenced by [[Jonas Dodoo]] and [[Peter Weyand]])
- To punch hard, need enough room to accelerate (thigh-angle needs to be high enough)
- Shortens at hip, lengthens at knee (helps minimize strain)

# Web-Summary

Ken Clark is a researcher and coach at West Chester University specializing in top-speed training science and force application research. His work focuses on understanding the biomechanical and physiological factors that determine maximum running velocity, with particular emphasis on ground-contact geometry, force application rates, and the relationship between contact distance, contact time, and running speed. Clark's research has identified that faster speeds are correlated with shorter contact times and greater rates of vertical force application, with elite sprinters demonstrating a higher initial spike in force into the ground. He has contributed to the understanding of thigh angular motion differences between team-sport athletes and elite sprinters, emphasizing the importance of symmetrical oscillation, increased amplitude, and faster frequency. Clark's "Fast Top-Speed Equation" (Fast Thigh Angular-Velo → Fast Foot-Touchdown Velo + Stiff Ground Contact → High Rate of vForce) provides a clear framework for understanding speed development. His work on the "whip from the hip" mechanism and the two-mass model has advanced understanding of how lower-leg impulse contributes to maximum velocity. Through his research and coaching, Clark has established himself as a leading authority on the science of top-speed training.
