## APEX Ready Program
20-week program to prepare for APEX covering GPP phase with structured programming.

### Program Structure
- **GPP Phase**: Speed days (early acceleration), lift days (force-lower, upper dynamic), structured programming
- **Components**: Throws, jumps, technical blocks, main speed work, ISO holds
- **Mile Prep Progression**: Detailed progression through GPP, Max-STR, Power, Specific Prep, and MaxV/Taper blocks

### Key Training Elements
- **Speed Work**: Early acceleration, late-accel/maxV
- **Lifting**: Force-lower, upper dynamic, upper volume + HIIT
- **ISOs**: Single-leg hip thrust, lunge ISOs
- **Oly Lifting**: Clean-pull, power-clean, hang-clean variations
- **Jumps**: Broad jumps, seated box-jumps, hurdle-hops
- **Throws**: MB reverse throw, MB scoop-toss
- **Technical Blocks**: Sled accel-march, ½ kneeling start, 4-step drill, buildups

# Web-Summary

Joe Pedulla is a coach known for his pragmatic coaching principles and the APEX Ready program, a 20-week comprehensive training system designed to prepare athletes for APEX competition. His approach emphasizes balancing skill development with strength development through practical, principle-based coaching that avoids over-complication. Pedulla's APEX Ready program includes structured GPP phases with detailed progressions through max-strength, power, specific prep, and max-velocity/taper blocks, integrating speed work, lifting, isometrics, Olympic lifting, jumps, throws, and technical blocks. His philosophy recognizes that effective coaching requires both understanding scientific principles and applying them in real-world settings with appropriate pragmatism. Through his work on pragmatic principles and his comprehensive training programs, Pedulla has established himself as a leading voice in practical strength and conditioning application, helping coaches navigate the balance between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. - Podcast episode with [[Tim Riley]]
