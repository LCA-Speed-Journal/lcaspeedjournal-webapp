## Speed Development for Sprinters
LSU coach covering comprehensive speed development approach.

### Components of Speed Development
- **Accel, MaxV**
- **Momentum**
- **Posture** - Joint Stabilization and Stretch-Shortening

## Acceleration Development
### Postural Establishment
- Better Posture in Accel makes it easier to hit better Posture in MaxV
- Want to create "straight lines" - easier to hammer the nail if you're angled correctly
- Trap: "can't hold good posture because they aren't strong enough" - Ab training isn't going to magically fix problem in most athletes

### Momentum Development Phase
- Traditional Definition: 0-40m

### Characteristics
- Frequency is slower, quickens throughout
- COM starts further in front, with foot contact slightly in front, and toe-off behind
- Each step is both forwards and upwards
- Looking for spine and shin to match angles

### Common Errors
- Not progressing upward with each step
- Trying to "stay low"
- Improper frequency development

### Protocols
- Establish Proper Start Positions - Standing, crouch, 3pt, 4pt, blocks
- Slow down the recommendations
- Recovery *can* be incomplete

### Training
- Up to 300m p/session (don't need to go that high, can do less)
- Break reps out into 15-40m - 3x (20, 30, 40), 3x20 + 3x30 + 3x40, etc.

## Max Velocity Development
### Postural Maintenance
- Traditional View is from (30-40m) - (60-70m) - 30-40m zone in middle of race

### Characteristics
- Fastest possible movement of body
- Fast, intense, but with **relaxation** - Looking to maintain element of relaxation even in practices
- High-Frequency
- Touchdown just barely in front of COM
- Toe-Off just barely behind
- Upright running
- Force is *downward*

### Common Errors
- **Not enough momentum from accel phase** - If we don't have it, want to "try and get it" by being overly aggressive and minimizing relaxation
- **Not working in the vertical** - Don't want to think about grabbing track, think about driving down and through
- **Poor posture** (brought on by bad accel-phase) - Bad posture means harder for joints to stabilize, can't effectively use ISO-strength when impact ground
- **Reaching for stride-length** - Longer length is caused by imparting more force into ground and "getting more bounce out of it"

### Training Protocols
- **Fly-In Runs**: 25-40m accel-zone, 10-30m Fly, Slow-Down zone of 15-30m
- **Ins & Outs**: 25m accel-zone, 30m total-zone broken into 2-halves (Hit and Relax)
- **Sprint-Float**: 50m accel, 20m float, 20m sprint
- **Recovery is FULL** on each rep (4-6mins)
- **Training**: 300-500m p/session

## Programming Throughout the Year
- **Accel** - Doing from Day 1
- **General Prep** - Heavy Emphasis
- **Specific Prep** - Begin to bring in some speed development, extending maxV zones
- **Pre-Comp & Comp** - Similar to Specific Prep

## Reminders
- Speed Development is always intense
- Pairing Intense Activities Together - plyos, heavy weights
- **Coach EVERYTHING** - Warmup to Cooldown
  - Cues should be short and simple - build common library
  - Don't be afraid to stop
  - Don't be afraid to amend - different event groups might have different capacities

# Web-Summary

Todd Lane is an LSU coach specializing in comprehensive speed development for sprinters, with particular emphasis on acceleration and max velocity development. His approach recognizes that better posture in acceleration makes it easier to achieve better posture in max velocity, emphasizing the creation of "straight lines" for optimal force application. Lane's acceleration philosophy challenges traditional thinking by stating "There's no such thing as the drive phase. The entire race is the drive phase," recognizing that while biomechanical phases exist, the athlete's experience is one of aggressive pushing throughout. His max-velocity training emphasizes the fastest possible movement with relaxation, high frequency, and proper force application downward rather than horizontally. Lane's protocols include fly-in runs, ins and outs, and sprint-float progressions, all with full recovery (4-6 minutes) and appropriate volume (300-500m per session). His programming progresses from acceleration emphasis on day one through general prep, specific prep, and pre-comp/comp phases, with careful attention to pairing intense activities together (plyos, heavy weights) and coaching everything from warmup to cooldown. Through his systematic approach to speed development, Lane has established a comprehensive methodology for developing sprint performance.
