# Big Ideas

## Triphasic Training System
Creator of Triphasic Training - a comprehensive training system that systematically develops the three phases of muscle contraction:

### Three Phases
1. **Eccentric Phase**: Lengthening under load
2. **Isometric Phase**: Static hold at transition point
3. **Concentric Phase**: Shortening/explosive phase

### Triphasic-Style GPP (General Physical Preparation)
- **Aerobic Phase**: Aerobic EDT, long ISOs
- **Lactic Phase**: Lactic EDT, moderate ISOs, long OSC reps
- **Alactic Phase**: Short ISOs (OVC), short OSC reps

### Key Principles
- Systematic development through each phase
- Transition from ECC to CON, sharpening the ISO portion of movement
- Power phase fits 5-7s range (not much above 10s)
- Used in summer prep, preseason to conference play, and in-season maintenance

## RPR (Reflexive Performance Reset)
Co-Founder with [[Chris Korfist]] - system for improving athletic performance and reducing pain by addressing neurological imbalances.

### Key Concepts
- Addresses neurological imbalances that affect performance
- Can be used intra-set to help tonus lower as set number increases
- Target muscles of primary patterns, then perform next set
- Timing: pre-speed/quality, post-conditioning
- "Double Inverted U" Method for intra-set RPR

## Isometrics
### Isometrics as Occlusion Training
- **~40s or less, 50% Load**
- Follow with 60s light-load, same muscle, continuous movement

### Specific ISO Applications
- **"Belt" SQ OVC ISO**: Almost preferred to supramaximal-ISO
- **Reverse-Hyper ISO**: For fixing 0-5m acceleration
- **Acceleration ISOs**: FFE Belt-SQ OVC ISO - need to get hip over back knee to mimic acceleration, load over front knee
- **MaxV ISOs**: Pause the Yuri at top. Stand-Phase: Driving forward. Clark-105's, training for fast switch and decent split: Hip-ISO Glute-Push
- **Agility and COD ISOs**: Hip IR, Groin-Adduction

### Programming Considerations
- ISOs are killer for STR, but can slow max-speed when used for whole block (only if elite, novice guys don't see as much)
- Follow up ISOs with Yuri or Prime-Times to offset
- Korfist likes doing specific endurance with longer-rep followed by iso-hold
- When doing longer reps (25-30+), tech needs to stay clean

## Prime-Times
### Applications
- **Pre-Games**: Activation and preparation
- **Posterior-Pattern Fixes**: Correcting movement patterns
- **Need to Push Ground Behind**: Don't cut things too short on striding
  - Look for undulation - means overly quad-dominant

### Types
- **Straight-Leg Prime-Times**: For maxV mechanics
- **Bent-Knee Prime-Times**: For acceleration and power
- **Toe-Up Prime-Times**: Technical development
- **Front-Sided Prime-Times**: Specific pattern development

### Key Coaching Points
- Need slight forward lean to get more out of prime times
- Don't rebound, want to push out the back, not just slap ground
- Once good, add weight
- Can be paired with GHD work

## Muscle Tonus
### Basic Theory
- **Muscle tonus (resting tension)** more responsible for sharp performance decline than "fatigue" might be
- Address for higher potential volume

### Fixing Tone
- **Tonus Too High**: Do faster stretch or drop-based exercise
- **Tonus Too Low**: OVC ISOs or short concentric work

### Intra-Set RPR
- Cal uses a gun, but hands work
- Helps tonus lower as set number increases
- Target muscles of primary patterns, then perform next set
- Timing: pre-speed/quality, post-conditioning

### Control Through Scap/Knee
- Control through the scap/kneecap helps dictate stability and speed of repositioning
- If these go, things deteriorate
- "If your mid-back goes bad? You're fucked." - [[Chris Korfist]]

## Key Training Principles
### Add Stress on Good Patterns
- Don't put added stress on already poor patterns
- Fix the pattern first, then add stress

### Misc Thoughts
- **Straight-Leg Lateral Skip**: Movement pattern development
- **Yuris in Doorways**: Accessibility and constraint-based training
- **Transition from ECC to CON**: Sharpening the ISO portion through Triphasic Training

# Web-Summary

Cal Dietz is the creator of the Triphasic Training system, a comprehensive approach that systematically develops the three phases of muscle contraction: eccentric (lengthening), isometric (static hold), and concentric (explosive shortening). He co-founded RPR (Reflexive Performance Reset) with Chris Korfist, a neurological reset system for improving athletic performance and reducing pain by addressing neurological imbalances. Dietz's training philosophy emphasizes the critical role of muscle tonus (resting tension) in performance, using specific isometric applications for acceleration, max velocity, and agility development. His work integrates occlusion training principles, prime-time exercises for pattern development, and a sophisticated understanding of how neuromuscular integration drives strength development. Through his involvement in Revolutions in Speed educational events and his systematic approach to periodization, Dietz has established himself as a leading voice in strength and conditioning, particularly in the application of isometric training and neurological principles to athletic performance.
