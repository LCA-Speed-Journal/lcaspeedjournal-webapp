### Discount Hurdling
Alec likes to practice at heights lower than race-height, and distances closer than race-distance.
This helps allow athletes to continue practicing at a high level of quality, while cementing good technical habits.
He, for the most part, sticks to 2 hurdles per rep, to still work in the three main areas of hurdling:
- Acceleration — Block to Hurdle 1
- Takeoff — Hurdle 1
- Transition and Continued Momentum — Between Hurdles 1 and 2
### Low-Impact Drills
These are Alec’s Daily-Drills, designed to minimize impacts but still allow athletes to practice their hurdle mechanics more regularly. They’re a combination of form and mobility, with a little bit of rhythm.
- Wall Drills — Cut-Step / Lead-Leg, Trail Leg
- Walkovers — Lead-Leg, Trail-Leg, Full-Walkovers
- Skip-Overs — Lead-Leg, Trail-Leg

# Web-Summary

Alec Holler is a hurdle coach known for his "discount hurdling" approach, which involves practicing at heights lower than race-height and distances closer than race-distance to allow athletes to maintain high quality while cementing good technical habits. His philosophy emphasizes that most of his hurdle work involves just 2 hurdles per rep, allowing focus on the three main areas of hurdling: acceleration (block to hurdle 1), takeoff (hurdle 1), and transition and continued momentum (between hurdles 1 and 2). Holler's low-impact daily drills are designed to minimize impacts while still allowing athletes to practice hurdle mechanics more regularly, combining form and mobility with rhythm work. These include wall drills (cut-step/lead-leg, trail leg), walkovers (lead-leg, trail-leg, full walkovers), and skip-overs (lead-leg, trail-leg). Through his systematic approach to hurdle training and his emphasis on quality over quantity, Holler has established a methodology that helps athletes develop proper hurdling technique while reducing injury risk and maintaining technical consistency.
