## The Power of Microdosing
Athletic Director of Sports Performance at Pitt - microdosing approach for in-season training.

### The What and the Why
How to train efficiently in-season, working around various constraints (scheduling for travel, practice, comps, meetings, class demands, etc.) to keep more frequent, consistent exposures.

### Why?
- **Availability and Training Time are at Premium** - Not uncommon to only get 1-2 training days a week for S&C
- Instead of low-level court warmup for 10-15min, why not warmup in weightroom for 20-30mins prior to practice?
  - More specific stimulus, can elevate level of play more than low-level warmup

### Adapting from Traditional Model
- **Sessions p/wk**: 2-3x p/wk → 8-10x p/wk
- **Lifts p/session**: 6-8x p/session → 1-3x p/session
- **Minutes p/session**: 35-45mins p/session → 15-20mins p/session
- **Total Work Done**: (same)

### The Microdosing Playbook: Variables to Consider
- Manipulate ROM
- Bilateral vs Unilateral
- Contact-Length
- Time-Under Tension
- Density (total training time, etc.)
- Contraction Type (CON-Only, ECC, ISOs, etc.)

### Timeline
Work with end in mind (work backwards)
- **Summer Prep** - Triphasic Focus
- **Preseason to Conference Play** - Touch-up on Triphasic aspects, keep exposures and retain qualities as long as possible
- **Conference Play** - Aligning stressors in weight room with stressors on court

### Example Week: Conference Play (Competition Phase)
- Mon - Regeneration and Recovery
- Tue - Strength (High-Force - see [[Hunter Eisenhower]] and Force System)
- Wed - Power and Accessories
- Thurs - Speed
- Fri - Game
- Sat - Primer / CNS-Work
- Sun - Game

### Testing and Assessment
- Tools used by Pitt: AMS, Smartabase upload, Processing, Sharing
- **Holistic Development**: Visuomotor Decision-Making, Strength, Power, Body-Comp, Psychosocial Profile

# Web-Summary

Stephanie Mock is the Athletic Director of Sports Performance at Pitt, known for her "Power of Microdosing" approach to in-season training that addresses the challenge of training efficiently around various constraints (scheduling for travel, practice, competitions, meetings, class demands). Her methodology adapts from traditional models by increasing sessions per week (2-3x → 8-10x) while reducing lifts per session (6-8x → 1-3x) and minutes per session (35-45mins → 15-20mins), maintaining the same total work done but with more frequent, consistent exposures. Mock's approach includes sophisticated manipulation of variables: ROM, bilateral vs unilateral, contact-length, time-under-tension, density, and contraction type (concentric-only, eccentric, isometrics, etc.). Her timeline progresses from summer prep (Triphasic focus) through preseason to conference play (touch-up on Triphasic aspects, maintaining exposures and retaining qualities) to conference play (aligning stressors in weight room with stressors on court). Mock's example week structure includes regeneration/recovery, strength (high-force), power and accessories, speed, games, and primer/CNS-work. Through her innovative microdosing approach, Mock has established a practical solution for maintaining training quality during competitive seasons with limited time availability.
