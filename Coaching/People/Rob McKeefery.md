## Outside the Box Speed Development
PLAE Perform outside the box speed development.

### Finding the Why
[[Simon Sinek]]'s Book, recommended again.
- Need to find "the athlete's WHY"
- **Question 1**: If you weren't (insert sport athlete), what would you do?
- **Question 2**: What's toughest thing you've been through in your life?
- **Question 3**: Who's most influential person in your life?
  - Many stories of calling them up and talking up athlete - has changed relationships with athletes

### Defining Terms
When we reduce things like speed down to "stride length x stride-frequency," can make it feel pretty immutable.
- Need to expand definitions to feel like athletes have more agency over changes

### Sprint Performance Model
Sprint Performance breaks out into:
- **Stride Frequency** - Feeds from Coordination and Speed
  - Develop with Body-Awareness, Movement Awareness, Balance
- **Stride Length** - Feeds from Strength
  - Develop with Strength-Training and Overload-Training
- **Technique** - Feeds from Flexibility, Mobility, and Sport-IQ
  - Warming up with physiological, biomechanical, and specific readiness
  - Flexibility and Mobility - Hurdle Mobility, Wall-Drills, etc.
  - Sport IQ - not just about raw outputs, but how you can use it on field/court

### Hands-On Component
- Tip: If no wall present (on field, etc), can use 2 additional athletes to form one
  - Athlete 1 stands tall as wall (feet together, arms at sides)
  - Athlete 2 stands on opposite side of Athlete 1, bracing them against performing athlete
  - Athlete performing drill uses Athlete 1 to brace against

# Web-Summary

Rob McKeefery is a PLAE Perform coach known for his "Outside the Box Speed Development" approach, which emphasizes finding "the athlete's WHY" through questions like "If you weren't (insert sport athlete), what would you do?", "What's toughest thing you've been through in your life?", and "Who's most influential person in your life?" (with many stories of calling them up and talking up athlete, changing relationships with athletes). His approach recognizes that when speed is reduced to "stride length x stride-frequency," it can feel immutable, so definitions need to be expanded to give athletes more agency over changes. McKeefery's sprint performance model breaks out into stride frequency (feeds from coordination and speed, developed with body-awareness, movement awareness, balance), stride length (feeds from strength, developed with strength-training and overload-training), and technique (feeds from flexibility, mobility, and sport-IQ, including warming up with physiological, biomechanical, and specific readiness, flexibility and mobility work like hurdle mobility and wall-drills, and sport IQ recognizing it's not just about raw outputs but how you can use it on field/court). His hands-on component includes innovative solutions like using 2 additional athletes to form a wall when no wall is present. Through his holistic approach to speed development that integrates psychological, technical, and physical components, McKeefery has established a comprehensive methodology for athletic performance.
