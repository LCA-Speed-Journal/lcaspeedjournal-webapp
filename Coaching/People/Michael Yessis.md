## 1x20 Method
Creator of 1x20 method applied by [[Jake Tuura]].

### Overview
- Performed 3x p/wk, 1-2wks p/phase
- One total-body workout, repeated across entire phase
- 1 set of prescribed reps (10, 15, or 20, depending on phase)
- Perfect Form requirement
- 30-45s rest between all exercises

### Phase Progression
- **Phase 1: 1x20** - Base phase, mostly isolation-driven movements
- **Phase 2: 1x15** - Progressing isolation lifts, combining into more compounds
- **Phase 3: 1x10** - All "basic lifting" compounds

### Key Principles
- Effective for youth/beginners
- Overload prerequisite for growth
- Criteria for specialized strength exercises
- Exercise transfer to sport
- Neuromuscular base of injuries
- Blood flow benefits

# Web-Summary

Dr. Michael Yessis is the creator of the 1x20 method, a comprehensive total-body training approach performed 3x per week, 1-2 weeks per phase, with one total-body workout repeated across the entire phase. The method uses 1 set of prescribed reps (10, 15, or 20, depending on phase) with perfect form requirement and 30-45 seconds rest between all exercises. Yessis's phase progression moves from Phase 1 (1x20—base phase, mostly isolation-driven movements) through Phase 2 (1x15—progressing isolation lifts, combining into more compounds) to Phase 3 (1x10—all "basic lifting" compounds). His key principles recognize that the method is effective for youth/beginners, that overload is prerequisite for growth, that there are criteria for specialized strength exercises, that exercise transfer to sport is important, that most injuries have neuromuscular base, and that the method provides blood flow benefits. Through his systematic approach to total-body training and his emphasis on perfect form and progressive complexity, Yessis has established a foundational training method that has been widely applied and refined by coaches like Jake Tuura.
