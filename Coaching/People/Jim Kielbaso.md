## Speed & Power Science
IYCA (International Youth Conditioning Association) - Overview of speed and power science.

### Basing Training in Science
When structuring training based on scientific principles, **avoid both extremes**:
- **Neuroticism, Analysis Paralysis** (see [[Austin Jochum]] for more on theory/repercussions)
  - Can lead to never actually developing a culture - bounce from framework to framework
  - Can lead to incongruence - "training whiplash" by constantly switching the main thing
- **"Making Stuff Up" or Only Being a Meathead**
  - Need to have at least reasonable hunch that training will benefit athletes
  - Helps if grounded in some manner of scientific principle

## Speed Definition
Very similar to [[Les Spellman]]'s definition in CSAC:
**"Large Forces into the Ground as Quickly As Possible, in the Right Direction (efficiently)"**

### Key Findings on Training/Developing Speed
#### Orientation of Force
- **Orientation of Force into Ground is primary determinant of running speed**
- For elite sprinters, they apply force into ground in different manner than regular people
- We know this is also shown in **higher initial spike in force into ground** (as [[Ken Clark]])

#### Force and Mechanics
- Faster sprinters have **greater overall force and enhanced mechanics** compared to slower runners
- Need to actually teach athletes how to run - PE won't do it, sport coaches don't usually do it

## Key Principles of Training
**Balancing Overload and Specificity**
- Systematically and progressively increase demands on body

## Strength and Speed
- The "big force into ground" comes from developing strength through key musculature
- **Caveat**: Strength helps *to a point*
- There's **diminishing returns** once you start getting really proficient with absolute-strength

### Squat Threshold
**2x Bodyweight** seems to be general threshold where strength starts to have diminishing returns

## Power Specificity Relative to Velocity
Understanding that power development needs to be specific to movement velocity requirements.

## Reactive Agility Considerations
Considerations for reactive agility training and development.

# Web-Summary

Jim Kielbaso is a coach with the International Youth Conditioning Association (IYCA) known for his science-based approach to speed and power development. His definition of speed—"Large Forces into the Ground as Quickly As Possible, in the Right Direction (efficiently)"—emphasizes the critical importance of force orientation and application rate. Kielbaso's philosophy balances scientific principles with practical application, warning against both extremes of neuroticism/analysis paralysis and "making stuff up." His work emphasizes that orientation of force into the ground is the primary determinant of running speed, with elite sprinters demonstrating higher initial spikes in force application. Kielbaso recognizes that strength helps speed development "to a point," with diminishing returns once athletes reach approximately 2x bodyweight squat thresholds. His approach to power development emphasizes specificity relative to movement velocity requirements, and he provides considerations for reactive agility training. Through his work with IYCA and his comprehensive understanding of speed and power science, Kielbaso has established himself as a leading educator in evidence-based youth athletic development.
