# Big Ideas

## Functional Neurology
Concepts related to functional neurology and neurological influences on speed development.

## Dimensions of the CNS
Popularized by Dan Fichter and [[Chris Korfist]], based on DB Hammer concept. Categorizes primary functions based on nervous system responses:

### Rate (Speed)
Speed of signaling from brain to muscle.
**Training Rate:**
- Drop-Catches
- Drop-Rebound Catches
- Reflexive Concentrics
- Oscillations

### Magnitude (Intensity)
How "intense" the signal to muscle is - representation of signal-density to turn on more motor-units in less time.
**Training Magnitude:**
- Acceleration-Focused Work (Short Accels, Resisted Accels)
- Jumps (For Distance, For Height)
- Bounds

### Duration (Capacity)
How long we can continue signaling a muscle.
**Training Duration:**
- Oscillations / AMRAPs for >7s
- Incomplete Rest-Intervals (Lactic Training)
- Clusters

# Web-Summary

Dan Fichter is a coach known for popularizing the "Dimensions of the CNS" framework, developed in collaboration with Chris Korfist and based on DB Hammer concepts, which categorizes training based on three primary nervous system responses: Rate (speed of signaling), Magnitude (intensity/signal density), and Duration (capacity for sustained signaling). His work in functional neurology explores how neurological influences affect speed development, with particular emphasis on understanding how the nervous system responds and adapts to training stimuli. Fichter's approach to training organization groups exercises by their neurological demands, recognizing that different training means target different dimensions of CNS function. Through his co-presentations with Chris Korfist and his involvement in Track Football Consortium events, Fichter has contributed to advancing the understanding of how neurological principles can be applied to enhance athletic performance and speed development, particularly in high school football contexts. His work bridges the gap between neuroscience and practical coaching application.
