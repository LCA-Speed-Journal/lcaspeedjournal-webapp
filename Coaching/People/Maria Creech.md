## Triple Jump Training
Colorado State triple jump training seminar.

### First Phase is Key
Even more than first phase, the **entry** into first phase (2-3 steps prior, and of course the approach) is critical.
- Cycling Practice
- Lots of hip strength (anterior hip)

### Starting Small
- **Step-Overs** - Foot on Box as "takeoff leg". Pull over box, aiming for horizontal hip projection
- **SL Hopping** - ~1x p/wk, 20m p/leg or so
- **Bounding** - Levels of bounding (1, 2, 3 - each is different level of sub-max)
- **Box-Phases**
- **Landings**
- **Box-Bounding**
- **Run-to-Bound**
- **Run-to-1st-Phase**
- **Consecutive 1st-Phase**
- **Short Approach Full-Phase**
- **Wicket-Runs** - Shorter/submax for posture, full-distance/speed as progression

### Frequency of Full-Jumps
- **Bounding** - All the time
- **Full-Phase Jumps** - 1x p/wk, 3-4 Reps p/session

### Coach Creech's Structure
- **Every-Day** - Straight-Leg Bounding (in warmup)
- **Early-Week** - Lower-Leg Plyos + Approaches
- **Late-Week** - Ground/Tech-Work, Skips, etc.

# Web-Summary

Maria Creech is a Colorado State coach specializing in triple jump training, with emphasis that even more than the first phase, the entry into first phase (2-3 steps prior, and of course the approach) is critical, requiring cycling practice and lots of hip strength (anterior hip). Her starting small progression includes step-overs (foot on box as "takeoff leg," pulling over box aiming for horizontal hip projection), single-leg hopping (~1x per week, 20m per leg), bounding (levels 1, 2, 3—each different level of sub-max), box-phases, landings, box-bounding, run-to-bound, run-to-1st-phase, consecutive 1st-phase, and short approach full-phase, with wicket-runs (shorter/submax for posture, full-distance/speed as progression). Creech's frequency recommendations emphasize bounding all the time, with full-phase jumps 1x per week, 3-4 reps per session. Her structure includes every-day straight-leg bounding (in warmup), early-week lower-leg plyos and approaches, and late-week ground/tech-work, skips, etc. Through her systematic progression from basic movements to full triple jump phases, Creech has established a comprehensive approach to developing triple jumpers.
