# Big Ideas

## Periodization Framework
MSU Mankato periodization framework covering verbiage and intent, generalized neuromuscular/energy-system breakdown, and training prescriptions.

### Verbiage and Intent
- **Volume** - Total amount of Training (progressive loading/unloading based on time of season and stimulus-goal)
- **Intensity** - Measured Difficulty of Training/Activity (percentage, based off testing data or PR performance)
- **Density** - How Often Theme is Present within Training Plan (high weekly speed density = multiple sessions in week)

## Generalized Neuromuscular / Energy-System Breakdown
### Absolute Speed
- **What** - Max Intensity (fastest 10-30m segment)
  - Generally, 30-80m reps depending on age/strength
  - Full recovery between sets and reps (1-1.5:1 ratio p/10m segment)
- **When** - Accel emphasis, then MaxV
  - "Driving, Pushing, Projection"
  - "Push yourself Tall"
- **How** - Combos of high-intensity over 30-80m
  - Fly-Runs (with 30m Accel-Zone)
  - Short Accels (30-50m)
  - Ladder Flys (Fly-10, Fly-20, Fly-30, all with 30m Accel)

### Speed Endurance
- **What** - Max-Intensity while Fighting Fatigue
  - 80-150m per rep, 300-900m of total volume
  - Increased technical focus after maxV
  - Recoveries based off overall goal/distance
- **When** - Locks in Speed Qualities
  - Concerted effort to build quality accel and maxV capacities first
  - Time-Trials, longer testing reps, and early-season races ARE SPEED ENDURANCE
- **How** - Repeat 100's, 120's, 150's
  - 3 x 120 - Fast as Possible, 8-10min recovery
  - 150, 120, 100 w/8-12min recovery

### Special Endurance
- **What** - High-Intensity focusing on glycolytic power and tolerance
  - Two suggestions, I and II, Full-Recovery needed based on distances
- **When** - Late into specific prep
- **How** - SP I (250, 200, 150 with 15min recovery), SP II (Broken 400's)

### Tempo
- **What** - Varied intensity working addressing aerobic/anaerobic
- **When** - Starting point based off event
- **How** - Extensive (10x100m on grass at 75% intensity), Intensive (6x200m at 80% with 2min recovery)

## Progressions of Sprint Training
- Accel
- Max-Velocity
- Speed Endurance
- Special Endurance

## Secondary Progressions
### Sprint Drills
- Allow for rehearsal of sprint components, coordination, and overall flexibility and ROM
- All-year-round in warmups - progress in intensity within each session

### Plyos and Multijumps
- Develop RSI and elastic abilities
- Force application and position of application
- SSC (CON, ISO, ECC)
- Progressive Building throughout season

### MB and Multithrows
- General strength to improve awareness/coordination
- Lower-intensity, controlled, likely in circuit

## Coaching Philosophy
"The single greatest impact on athlete's performance is your philosophy"
- Lens through which you see world
- Profound effect on training decisions
- Know the rules before you bend the rules (training theory, apply and adjust)
- Nothing right or wrong, just rational and irrational
- Let it change over time as knowledge increases
- **Parno: Success-Driven, Science-Backed**
  - Athlete-coach relationship takes forefront for future success

## General Sequencing
- General to Specific
- Simple to Complex
- Capacity to Power
- In-Place Jumps → Baby Bounds → Speed Bounds
- Gen Strength → Power → Abs. STR → Reactive STR

## Compatible and Complimentary Training
- Grouping by Training Demand
- If it's a neuro day, it's a neuro day - Components are going to be neuro-focused
- Daily Plans: Start with highest demand (accel before multi-throws, general strength before/after tempo)

## Hurdle Drills System
Comprehensive hurdle drill system covering:
- Static drills
- Dynamic drills
- In-place/walking drills
- Equipment usage
- Warmup examples
- Specialized problem-solving drills

# Web-Summary

Chris Parno is an MSU Mankato coach known for his comprehensive periodization framework covering verbiage and intent (volume, intensity, density), generalized neuromuscular/energy-system breakdown, and training prescriptions. His system organizes training qualities into Absolute Speed (max intensity, fastest 10-30m segment, generally 30-80m reps, full recovery), Speed Endurance (max-intensity while fighting fatigue, 80-150m per rep, 300-900m total volume), Special Endurance (high-intensity focusing on glycolytic power and tolerance), and Tempo (varied intensity addressing aerobic/anaerobic). Parno's progressions move from acceleration through max-velocity, speed endurance, and special endurance, with secondary progressions including sprint drills (all-year-round in warmups, progressing in intensity), plyos and multijumps (developing RSI and elastic abilities, force application and position of application, stretch-shortening cycle), and med-ball and multithrows (general strength, lower-intensity, controlled, likely in circuit). His coaching philosophy emphasizes that "the single greatest impact on athlete's performance is your philosophy," recognizing that philosophy serves as the lens through which coaches see the world and has profound effect on training decisions. Parno's approach is "Success-Driven, Science-Backed," with athlete-coach relationship taking forefront for future success. Through his comprehensive hurdle drills system and systematic periodization approach, Parno has established a detailed framework for sprint and hurdle development.
