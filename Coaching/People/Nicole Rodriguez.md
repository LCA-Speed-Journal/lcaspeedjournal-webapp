# Big Ideas

## Simple Approach
EXOS simple approach covering big ideas and practical application.

### Big Ideas
- **Simple does not mean easy** - Clear and concise, get to point, but be excellent

### The 3 Buckets at EXOS
- **Position** - Root Skills, Fundamental Strength in various body-positions, etc.
- **Pattern** - Coordination and Body-Awareness
- **Power** - Neural Outputs

### How to Determine Who Belongs to What Bucket?
- **Vertical Jump Profile** is big assessment used at EXOS
  - Non CMJ, CMJ, Depth Jump (40cm Box)
  - Should see 5-15% increase from Non-CMJ to CMJ - EUR
  - Men should be 26", Women should be 19" - Nicole's Thresholds

### EXOS Session Outline
- **Pillar Prep** - Address individual needs (3-7mins)
- **Movement Prep** - Address needs of session (skills, etc.)
- **Movement Skills** - Efficiency and specific strength (Med-Ball work, etc.)
- **Strength and Power** - Supporting movements used in activity
- **Energy System Development** - Metabolic stress / conditioning
- **Regeneration** - Self-care

### Big Questions
- What are tools you actually use?
- What are tools you're really comfortable with leveraging?

### What do Athletes Need?
- Movement
- Mindset
- Nutrition
- Recovery
- Job of coach: how to blend pillars together and individualize to what each athlete needs

### On-Field Practical
- **Split-Drop into Acceleration** - Not immediate accel. Drop, switch (1-2x), then out
- **Wall-Drill** - Can be used to teach hip-projection
- **Heavy Sled-Walks** - Teaching forward lean and strength of extension

# Web-Summary

Nicole Rodriguez is an EXOS coach known for her "Simple Always Wins" philosophy, which emphasizes that simple does not mean easy—coaching should be clear and concise, getting to the point while maintaining excellence. Her approach organizes training into three buckets: Position (root skills, fundamental strength in various body positions), Pattern (coordination and body-awareness), and Power (neural outputs). Rodriguez uses the Vertical Jump Profile as a major assessment tool, including non-countermovement jump, countermovement jump, and depth jump (40cm box), with expectations of 5-15% increase from non-CMJ to CMJ (utilizing elastic utilization ratio) and thresholds of 26" for men and 19" for women. Her EXOS session outline includes pillar prep (addressing individual needs, 3-7 minutes), movement prep (addressing needs of session, skills), movement skills (efficiency and specific strength, med-ball work), strength and power (supporting movements used in activity), energy system development (metabolic stress/conditioning), and regeneration (self-care). Rodriguez's on-field practical applications include split-drop into acceleration (not immediate accel, but drop, switch 1-2x, then out), wall-drill for teaching hip-projection, and heavy sled-walks for teaching forward lean and strength of extension. Through her emphasis on simplicity and systematic organization, Rodriguez has established a practical framework for comprehensive athletic development.
