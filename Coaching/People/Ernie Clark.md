## Simple Approach to Coaching Hurdlers as Sprinters
NAU, Ashland University simple approach covering compatible training themes.

### Hurdlers Can Become Lots of Things
- Best Body-Control Athletes
- Responsive off ground (built with plyos)
- Great accelerators, focused and resilient
- Wide Range - 60m to 400m
- Amongst Fastest Sprinters in Program - Relay Keys

### Coaching the Hurdler as a Sprinter
- Coach principles you believe to be important
- Mobility and Strength (Hip-Flexors)
- Acceleration and Aggression - Intensity
- Foot Strike and Dorsiflexion
- Posture
- Overall training themes and fundamentals between sprinters/hurdlers is basically same
- Can combine two groups into one practice, though session might change mid-practice

### Design the Day - Themes and Purpose
- **Stick to ~48hrs between high-Neural Days**
- **Mix in Recovery Days** - More important to sprints/power-athletes than some want to believe (connects to [[Tony Holler]] and [[Alec Holler]])

### Day-Types
- **Conditioning and Tempo** - Early-week
- **Acceleration and Starts** - Early-midweek
- **Max-Velocity** - Mid-late in week
- **Recovery** - ~3 days p/wk

### Building Your Practices
- What do you want theme to be? (Accel, tech, tempo, MaxV, Mix, etc.)
- What would you do for sprinter? Make distances similar, but think in hurdles
- Quality over Quantity, both in Hurdles and in Sprints
- Make Warmup Purposeful
- Build on Last Week, Last Meet, etc.

### Keeping it Simple
- Acceleration - mixing in hurdle-drills, hurdle-work, and non-hurdle work
- MaxV - mixing in Max-V hurdle reps afterward
- Can mix Short and Long-Hurdles in same practice (short first)
- Build off Purpose and Theme

# Web-Summary

Ernie Clark is an NAU and Ashland University coach known for his simple approach to coaching hurdlers as sprinters, recognizing that hurdlers can become the best body-control athletes, responsive off the ground (built with plyos), great accelerators, focused and resilient, with wide range (60m to 400m) and often among the fastest sprinters in the program (relay keys). His approach emphasizes that overall training themes and fundamentals between sprinters and hurdlers are basically the same, allowing coaches to combine two groups into one practice (though session might change mid-practice). Clark's day-types include conditioning and tempo (early-week), acceleration and starts (early-midweek), max-velocity (mid-late in week), and recovery (~3 days per week), with emphasis on sticking to ~48 hours between high-neural days and mixing in recovery days (more important to sprints/power-athletes than some want to believe). His building practices approach asks coaches to determine theme (accel, tech, tempo, maxV, mix, etc.), consider what they would do for sprinter and make distances similar but think in hurdles, emphasize quality over quantity in both hurdles and sprints, make warmup purposeful, and build on last week, last meet, etc. Through his systematic approach to integrating hurdler and sprinter training, Clark has established a practical framework for coaches working with both groups.
