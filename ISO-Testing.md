Options with the Voltra to gather force-output metrics for athletes.
- Ankle Dorsiflexion — stand on box with an ankle cuff, and calf-raise against the cable
- Adduction — setup as ankle, but turn 90º. Place the cuff-leg just outside shoulder-width, and pull towards midline
- Hamstring-Driven Hip-Extension — as Natera’s RSIST. Set up as a hip-thrust, but elevate the athlete with boxes to give room for the cable under their hips. 
	- Perform Single-Leg.
- Hamstring Curl — set up leg-curl attachment on the Nordic-Hyper bench, with the cable modifier applied.
	- Perform Single-Leg.
