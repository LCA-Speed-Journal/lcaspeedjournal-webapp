### Fundraising Checkpoint Summary

| Fundraising Goal | What You Can Achieve | Status |
|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **$15,000** | Permits secured, project planning complete | ✅ Phase 1 Complete |
| **$200,000** | Site prepared (graded, drained, ready for base) | ✅ Phase 2 Complete |
| **$500,000** | Foundation/base construction complete | ✅ Phase 3 Complete |
| **$1,100,000** | Track surface installed - **TRACK IS USABLE** | ✅ Phase 4 Complete |
| **$1,100,000+** | Fencing installed - **FULLY ENCLOSED TRACK** | ✅ Phase 5 Complete |
| **$1,400,000** | Complete project with 10% contingency buffer | ✅ Project Complete |

*Note: Labor costs ($100K-$200K) are distributed across phases and included in phase totals. Costs refined based on flat farmland site conditions, polyurethane surface, and basic fencing requirements.*

### Staging Strategy Notes

- **Phase 1-2** can be completed independently and prepare the site for future work
- **Phase 3** (base construction) must be completed before Phase 4 (track surface)
- **Phase 4** represents the major milestone: a **usable track** once complete
- **Phase 5** (fencing) can be completed at any time, even after the track is operational
- **Labor costs** are typically allocated proportionally across phases as work progresses
- Each phase can serve as a **natural stopping point** for staged construction or fundraising

## Base Estimate Range
**Total Project Cost: $775,000 - $1,305,000** (without contingency)  
**Total Project Cost: $853,000 - $1,436,000** (with 10% contingency)
